/*
The goal of this tutorial is two-fold:
a) Correctly number each table and figure (e.g. Table 1, Figure 1) with a caption element and div of `figure-caption`, respectively
b) Ensure that each link (<a>) element of class `needs-label` that references a figure or table replaces its [LINK]
  text with the numbering of the referenced table/figure
In addition to the string(ident) function, easybake also provides a target-string(string, ident) function
  which will return the value of string(ident) in the context of the element with the id=string[1..-1].
  Use this to achieve the linking present in the baked version of this file.
