      </span>
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1133038">Concerts, sports games, and political rallies can have very large crowds. When you attend one of these events, you may know only the people you came with. Yet you may experience a feeling of connection to the group. You are one of the crowd. You cheer and applaud when everyone else does. You boo and yell alongside them. You move out of the way when someone needs to get by, and you say "excuse me" when you need to leave. You know how to behave in this kind of crowd.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2337466">It can be a very different experience if you are traveling in a foreign country and find yourself in a crowd moving down the street. You may have trouble figuring out what is happening. Is the crowd just the usual morning rush, or is it a political protest of some kind? Perhaps there was some sort of accident or disaster. Is it safe in this crowd, or should you try to extract yourself? How can you find out what is going on? Although you are <em data-effect="italics">in</em> it, you may not feel like you are <em data-effect="italics">part</em> of this crowd. You may not know what to do or how to behave.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1354186">Even within one type of crowd, different groups exist and different behaviors are on display. At a rock concert, for example, some may enjoy singing along, others prefer to sit and observe, while still others may join in a mosh pit or try crowd surfing. Why do we feel and act differently in different types of social situations? Why might people of a single group exhibit different behaviors in the same situation? Why might people acting similarly not feel connected to others exhibiting the same behavior? These are some of the many questions sociologists ask as they study people and societies.</p>

    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1445354">A dictionary defines <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1982011">sociology</span> as the systematic study of society and social interaction. The word &#8220;sociology&#8221; is derived from the Latin word <em data-effect="italics">socius</em> (companion) and the Greek word <em data-effect="italics">logos</em> (study of), meaning &#8220;the study of companionship.&#8221; While this is a starting point for the discipline, sociology is actually much more complex. It uses many different methods to study a wide range of subject matter and to apply these studies to the real world.</p>
    <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2217874"><h1 data-type="title">What Are Society and Culture?</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id2094832">Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society. A society is a group of people whose members interact, reside in a definable area, and share a culture. A culture includes the group&#8217;s shared practices, values, and beliefs. One sociologist might analyze video of people from different societies as they carry on everyday conversations to study the rules of polite conversation from different world cultures. Another sociologist might interview a representative sample of people to see how texting has changed the way they communicate. Yet another sociologist might study how migration determined the way in which language spread and changed over time. A fourth sociologist might be part of a team developing signs to warn people living thousands of years in the future, and speaking many different languages, to stay away from still-dangerous nuclear waste.</p>
   </section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1385827"><h1 data-type="title">The Sociological Imagination</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id784416">Although these studies and the methods of carrying them out are different, the sociologists involved in them all have something in common. Each of them looks at society using what pioneer sociologist C. Wright Mills called the sociological imagination, sometimes also referred to as the sociological lens or sociological perspective. Mills defined <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1305744">sociological imagination</span> as how individuals understand their own and others&#8217; pasts in relation to history and social structure (1959).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2104961">By looking at individuals and societies and how they interact through this lens, sociologists are able to examine what influences behavior, attitudes, and culture. By applying systematic and scientific methods to this process, they try to do so without letting their own biases and pre-conceived ideas influence their conclusions.</p>
     <section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1327201"><h2 data-type="title">Studying Patterns: How Sociologists View Society</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id2351172">All sociologists are interested in the experiences of individuals and how those experiences are shaped by interactions with social groups and society as a whole. To a sociologist, the personal decisions an individual makes do not exist in a vacuum. Cultural patterns and social forces put pressure on people to select one choice over another. Sociologists try to identify these general patterns by examining the behavior of large groups of people living in the same society and experiencing the same societal pressures.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1499018">The recent turmoil in the U.S. housing market and the high rate of foreclosures offer an example of how a sociologist might explore social patterns. Owning a home has long been considered an essential part of the American Dream. People often work for years to save for a down payment on what will be the largest investment they ever make. The monthly mortgage is often a person&#8217;s largest budget item. Missing one or more mortgage payments can result in serious consequences. The lender may foreclose on the mortgage and repossess the property. People may lose their homes and may not be able to borrow money in the future. Walking away from the responsibility to pay debts is not a choice most people make easily.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2282191">About three million homes were repossessed in the United States between 2006 and 2011. Experts predict the number could double by 2013 (Levy and Gop 2011). This is a much higher rate than the historical average. What social factors are contributing to this situation, and where might sociologists find patterns? Do Americans view debt, including mortgages, differently than in the past? What role do unemployment rates play? Might a shift in class structure be an influential factor? What about the way major economic players operate?</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2619523">To answer these questions, sociologists will look beyond individual foreclosures at national trends. They will see that in recent years unemployment has been at record highs. They will observe that many lenders approved subprime mortgages with adjustable rates that started low and ballooned. They may look into whether unemployment and lending practices were different for members of different social classes, races, or genders. By analyzing the impact of these external conditions on individuals&#8217; choices, sociologists can better explain why people make the decisions they do.</p>
    <figure id="import-auto-id1671852"><figcaption>Risky bank loans, falling housing prices, and high unemployment can result in higher foreclosure rates.

      </span>
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id2287778">Another example of how society influences individual decisions can be seen in people&#8217;s opinions about and use of food stamps (also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP benefits). Some people believe that those who receive food stamps are lazy and unmotivated. Statistics from the United States Department of Agriculture show a complex picture.</p>

</tbody></table><p id="import-auto-id2329365">The percentage of the population receiving food stamps is much higher in certain states than in others. Does this mean, if the stereotype above were applied, that people in some states are lazier and less motivated than those in other states? Sociologists study the economies in each state&#8212;comparing unemployment rates, food, energy costs, and other factors&#8212;to explain differences in social issues like this.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2866362">To identify social trends, sociologists also study how people use food stamps and how people react to their use. Research has found that for many people from all classes, there is a strong stigma attached to the use of food stamps. This stigma can prevent people who qualify for this type of assistance from using food stamps. According to Hanson and Gundersen (2002), how strongly this stigma is felt is linked to the general economic climate. This illustrates how sociologists observe a pattern in society.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1387358">Sociologists identify and study patterns related to all kinds of contemporary social issues. The &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; policy, the emergence of the Tea Party as a political faction, how Twitter has influenced everyday communication&#8212;these are all examples of topics that sociologists might explore.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id792706">A key basis of the sociological perspective is the concept that the individual and society are inseparable. It is impossible to study one without the other. German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1364002">figuration</span>. He described it through a metaphor of dancing. There can be no dance without the dancers, but there can be no dancers without the dance. Without the dancers, a dance is just an idea about motions in a choreographer&#8217;s head. Without a dance, there is just a group of people moving around a floor. Similarly, there is no society without the individuals that make it up, and there are also no individuals who are not affected by the society in which they live (Elias 1978).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id3035820">An application that makes this concept understandable is the practice of religion. While people experience their religion in a distinctly individual manner, religion exists in a larger social context. For instance, an individual&#8217;s religious practice may be influenced by what government dictates, holidays, teachers, places of worship, rituals, and so on. These influences underscore the important relationship between individual practices of religion and social pressures that influence that religious experience.</p></section>

    <p id="import-auto-id1350084">When sociologist Nathan Kierns spoke to his friend Ashley (a pseudonym) about the move she and her partner had made from an urban center to a small Midwestern town, he was curious how the social pressures placed on a lesbian couple differed from one community to the other. Ashley said that in the city they had been accustomed to getting looks and hearing comments when she and her partner walked hand in hand. Otherwise, she felt that they were at least being tolerated. There had been little to no outright discrimination.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1362194">Things changed when they moved to the small town for her partner&#8217;s job. For the first time, Ashley found herself experiencing direct discrimination because of her sexual orientation. Some of it was particularly hurtful. Landlords would not rent to them. Ashley, who is a highly trained professional, had a great deal of difficulty finding a new job.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1338201">When Nathan asked Ashley if she and her partner became discouraged or bitter about this new situation, Ashley said that rather than letting it get to them, they decided to do something about it. Ashley approached groups at a local college and several churches in the area. Together they decided to form the town's first gay-straight alliance.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1350096">The alliance has worked successfully to educate their community about same-sex couples. It also worked to raise awareness about the kinds of discrimination Ashley and her partner experienced in the town and how those could be eliminated. The alliance has become a strong advocacy group, working to attain equal rights for LBGT individuals.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2690429">Kierns observed that this is an excellent example of how negative social forces can result in a positive response from individuals to bring about social change (Kierns 2011).</p>

</figure><p id="import-auto-id3036948">Since ancient times, people have been fascinated by the relationship between individuals and the societies to which they belong. Many of the topics that are central to modern sociological scholarship were studied by ancient philosophers. Many of these earlier thinkers were motivated by their desire to describe an ideal society.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1461550">In the 13th century, Ma Tuan-Lin, a Chinese historian, first recognized social dynamics as an underlying component of historical development in his seminal encyclopedia, <em data-effect="italics">General Study of Literary Remains</em>. The next century saw the emergence of the historian some consider to be the world&#8217;s first sociologist: Ibn Khaldun (1332&#8211;1406) of Tunisia. He wrote about many topics of interest today, setting a foundation for both modern sociology and economics, including a theory of social conflict, a comparison of nomadic and sedentary life, a description of political economy, and a study connecting a tribe&#8217;s social cohesion to its capacity for power (Hannoum 2003).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1301703">In the 18th century, Age of Enlightenment philosophers developed general principles that could be used to explain social life. Thinkers such as John Locke, Voltaire, Immanuel Kant, and Thomas Hobbes responded to what they saw as social ills by writing on topics that they hoped would lead to social reform.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1641982">The early 19th century saw great changes with the Industrial Revolution, increased mobility, and new kinds of employment. It was also a time of great social and political upheaval with the rise of empires that exposed many people&#8212;for the first time&#8212;to societies and cultures other than their own. Millions of people were moving into cities and many people were turning away from their traditional religious beliefs.</p>

      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1300071">The term sociology was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Siey&#232;s (1748&#8211;1836) in an unpublished manuscript (Faur&#233; et al. 1999). In 1838, the term was reinvented by Auguste Comte (1798&#8211;1857). Comte originally studied to be an engineer, but later became a pupil of social philosopher Claude Henri de Rouvroy Comte de Saint-Simon (1760&#8211;1825). They both thought that society could be studied using the same scientific methods utilized in natural sciences. Comte also believed in the potential of social scientists to work toward the betterment of society. He held that once scholars identified the laws that governed society, sociologists could address problems such as poor education and poverty (Abercrombie et al. 2000).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2619052">Comte named the scientific study of social patterns <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2298441">positivism</span>. He described his philosophy in a series of books called <em data-effect="italics">The Course in Positive Philosophy</em> (1830&#8211;1842) and <em data-effect="italics">A General View of Positivism</em> (1848). He believed that using scientific methods to reveal the laws by which societies and individuals interact would usher in a new &#8220;positivist&#8221; age of history. While the field and its terminology have grown, sociologists still believe in the positive impact of their work.</p>

<figure id="id2744413"><figcaption>Karl Marx was one of the founders of sociology. His ideas about social conflict are still relevant today. (Photo courtesy of John Mayall/Wikimedia Commons)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id1677342" data-alt="A photo of Karl Marx.">

  </span>
</figure><p id="import-auto-id1748115">Karl Marx (1818&#8211;1883) was a German philosopher and economist. In 1848 he and Friedrich Engels (1820&#8211;1895) coauthored the <em data-effect="italics">Communist Manifesto</em>. This book is one of the most influential political manuscripts in history. It also presents Marx's theory of society, which differed from what Comte proposed.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1365379">Marx rejected Comte's positivism. He believed that societies grew and changed as a result of the struggles of different social classes over the means of production. At the time he was developing his theories, the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism led to great disparities in wealth between the owners of the factories and workers. Capitalism, an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of goods and the means to produce them, grew in many nations.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1684316">Marx predicted that inequalities of capitalism would become so extreme that workers would eventually revolt. This would lead to the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by communism. Communism is an economic system under which there is no private or corporate ownership: everything is owned communally and distributed as needed. Marx believed that communism was a more equitable system than capitalism.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1369857">While his economic predictions may not have come true in the time frame he predicted, Marx&#8217;s idea that social conflict leads to change in society is still one of the major theories used in modern sociology.</p>

    <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169033069407"><h1 data-type="title">Creating a Discipline</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id1362363">In 1873, the English philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820&#8211;1903) published <em data-effect="italics">The Study of Sociology</em>, the first book with the term &#8220;sociology&#8221; in the title. Spencer rejected much of Comte&#8217;s philosophy as well as Marx's theory of class struggle and his support of communism. Instead, he favored a form of government that allowed market forces to control capitalism. His work influenced many early sociologists including &#201;mile Durkheim (1858&#8211;1917).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2770260">Durkheim helped establish sociology as a formal academic discipline by establishing the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895 and by publishing his <em data-effect="italics">Rules of the Sociological Method</em> in 1895. In another important work, <em data-effect="italics">Division of Labour in Society</em> (1893), Durkheim laid out his theory on how societies transformed from a primitive state into a capitalist, industrial society. According to Durkheim, people rise to their proper level in society based on merit.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1207081">Durkheim believed that sociologists could study objective &#8220;social facts&#8221; (Poggi 2000). He also believed that through such studies it would be possible to determine if a society was &#8220;healthy&#8221; or &#8220;pathological.&#8221; He saw healthy societies as stable, while pathological societies experienced a breakdown in social norms between individuals and society.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1453104">In 1897, Durkheim attempted to demonstrate the effectiveness of his rules of social research when he published a work titled <em data-effect="italics">Suicide</em>. Durkheim examined suicide statistics in different police districts to research differences between Catholic and Protestant communities. He attributed the differences to socioreligious forces rather than to individual or psychological causes.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2916989">Prominent sociologist Max Weber (1864&#8211;1920) established a sociology department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich in 1919. Weber wrote on many topics related to sociology including political change in Russia and social forces that affect factory workers. He is known best for his 1904 book, <em data-effect="italics">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>. The theory that Weber sets forth in this book is still controversial. Some believe that Weber was arguing that the beliefs of many Protestants, especially Calvinists, led to the creation of capitalism. Others interpret it as simply claiming that the ideologies of capitalism and Protestantism are complementary.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2281913">Weber also made a major contribution to the methodology of sociological research. Along with other researchers such as Wilhelm Dilthey (1833&#8211;1911) and Heinrich Rickert (1863&#8211;1936), Weber believed that it was difficult if not impossible to use standard scientific methods to accurately predict the behavior of groups as people hoped to do. They argued that the influence of culture on human behavior had to be taken into account. This even applied to the researchers themselves, who, they believed, should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research. To deal with this problem, Weber and Dilthey introduced the concept of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1510093"><em data-effect="italics">verstehen</em></span>, a German word that means to understand in a deep way. In seeking verstehen, outside observers of a social world&#8212;an entire culture or a small setting&#8212;attempt to understand it from an insider&#8217;s point of view.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2859898">In his book <em data-effect="italics">The Nature of Social Action</em> (1922), Weber described sociology as striving to "interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces." He and other like-minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1311983">antipositivism</span> whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes, cultural norms, and societal values. This approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict (traditional in science), but to systematically gain an in-depth understanding of social worlds.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1472366">The different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1663681">Quantitative sociology</span> uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants. Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1588657">Qualitative sociology</span> seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and analysis of content sources (like books, magazines, journals, and popular media).</p>
  <div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1435922" class="note sociology-policy-debate" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">How Do Working Moms Impact Society?</div>
    <p id="import-auto-id2351172">What constitutes a &#8220;typical family&#8221; in America has changed tremendously over the past decades. One of the most notable changes has been the increasing number of mothers who work outside the home. Earlier in U.S. society, most family households consisted of one parent working outside the home and the other being the primary childcare provider. Because of traditional gender roles and family structures, this was typically a working father and a stay-at-home mom. Quantitative research shows that in 1940 only 27 percent of all women worked outside the home. Today, 59.2 percent of all women do. Almost half of women with children younger than one year of age are employed (U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee Report 2010).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1761085">Sociologists interested in this topic might approach its study from a variety of angles. One might be interested in its impact on a child&#8217;s development, another may explore related economic values, while a third might examine how other social institutions have responded to this shift in society.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2268584">A sociologist studying the impact of working mothers on a child&#8217;s development might ask questions about children raised in childcare settings. How is a child socialized differently when raised largely by a childcare provider rather than a parent? Do early experiences in a school-like childcare setting lead to improved academic performance later in life? How does a child with two working parents perceive gender roles compared to a child raised with a stay-at-home parent?</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1370195">Another sociologist might be interested in the increase in working mothers from an economic perspective. Why do so many households today have dual incomes? Has there been a contributing change in social class expectations? What impact does the larger economy play in the economic conditions of an individual household? Do people view money&#8212;savings, spending, debt&#8212;differently than they have in the past?</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id889910">Curiosity about this trend&#8217;s influence on social institutions might lead a researcher to explore its effect on the nation&#8217;s educational system. Has the increase in working mothers shifted traditional family responsibilities onto schools, such as providing lunch and even breakfast for students? How does the creation of after-school care programs shift resources away from traditional academics?</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1754655">As these examples show, sociologists study many real-world topics. Their research often influences social policies and political issues. Results from sociological studies on this topic might play a role in developing federal laws like the Family and Medical Leave Act, or they might bolster the efforts of an advocacy group striving to reduce social stigmas placed on stay-at-home dads, or they might help governments determine how to best allocate funding for education.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id1390478">Sociology was developed as a way to study and try to understand the changes to society brought on by the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the earliest sociologists thought that societies and individuals&#8217; roles in society could be studied using the same scientific methodologies that were used in the natural sciences, while others believed that is was impossible to predict human behavior scientifically, and still others debated the value of such predictions. Those perspectives continue to be represented within sociology today.</p>

    </figure><p id="import-auto-id2318371">Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns. They then develop theories to explain why these occur and what can result from them. In sociology, a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1820599">theory</span> is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create testable propositions about society (Allan 2006).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2875826">For example, early in the development of sociology, &#201;mile Durkheim was interested in explaining the social phenomenon of suicide. He gathered data on large groups of people in Europe who had ended their lives. When he analyzed the data, he found that suicide rates differed among groups with different religious affiliations. For example, the data showed that Protestants were more likely to commit suicide than Catholics.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2269425">To explain this, Durkheim developed the concept of social solidarity. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1295799">Social solidarity</span> described the social ties that bind a group of people together such as kinship, shared location, or religion. Durkheim combined these concepts with the data he analyzed to propose a theory that explained the religion-based differences in suicide rates. He suggested that differences in social solidarity between the two groups corresponded to the differences in suicide rates.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2014959">Although some have disagreed with his methods and his conclusions, Durkheim's work shows the importance of theory in sociology. Proposing theories supported by data gives sociologists a way to explain social patterns and to posit cause-and-effect relationships in social situations.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2682416">Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues they are meant to explain. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1662309">Grand theories</span>, also described as <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1682619">macro-level</span>, are attempts to explain large-scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change. These theories tend to be abstract and can be difficult if not impossible to test empirically. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2675415">Micro-level theories</span> are at the other end of the scale and cover very specific relationships between individuals or small groups. They are dependent on their context and are more concrete. This means they are more scientifically testable.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2785314">An example of a micro-theory would be a theory to explain why middle-class teenage girls text to communicate instead of making telephone calls. A sociologist might develop a hypothesis that the reason they do this is because they think texting is silent and therefore more private. A sociologist might then conduct interviews or design a survey to test this hypothesis. If there is enough supportive data, a hypothesis can become a theory.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2854935">Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete. Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current, but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them (Calhoun 2002).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1174338">In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help to explain many different aspects of social life. These theories are so prominent that many consider them paradigms. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1683059">Paradigms</span> are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories, generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them. Three of these paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking because they provide useful explanations: structural functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id2768417"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2619561">Functionalism</span>, also called structural functional theory, sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of individuals who make up that society. It is the oldest of the main theories of sociology. In fact, its origins began before sociology emerged as a formal discipline. It grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist Herbert Spencer (1820&#8211;1903) who likened society to a human body. He argued that just as the various organs in the body work together to keep the entire system functioning and regulated, the various parts of society work together to keep the entire society functioning and regulated (Spencer 1898). By parts of society, Spencer was referring to such social institutions as the economy, political systems, healthcare, education, media, and religion. Spencer continued the analogy by pointing out that societies evolve just as the bodies of humans and other animals do (Maryanski and Turner 1992).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1347997">One of the founders of sociology, Emile Durkheim, applied Spencer&#8217;s analogy to explain the structure of societies and how they change and survive over time. Durkheim believed that earlier, more primitive societies were held together because most people performed similar tasks and shared values, language, and symbols. They exchanged goods and services in similar ways. Modern societies, according to Durkheim, were more complex. People served many different functions in society and their ability to carry out their function depended upon others being able to carry out theirs. Durkheim's theory sees society as a complex system of interrelated parts, working together to maintain stability (Durkheim 1893). According to this sociological viewpoint, the parts of society are interdependent. This means each part influences the others. In a healthy society, all of these parts work together to produce a stable state called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1493654">dynamic equilibrium</span> (Parsons 1961).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id784416">Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society, but in order to study society, sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1364072">Social facts</span> are the laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashions, rituals, and all of the cultural rules that govern social life (Durkheim 1895). Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society. For example, one function of a society&#8217;s laws may be to protect society from violence, while another is to punish criminal behavior, while another is to preserve public health.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2687307">The English sociologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown (1881&#8211;1955) shared Comte's and Durkheim's views. He believed that how these functions worked together to maintain a stable society was controlled by laws that could be discovered through systematic comparison (Broce 1973). Like Durkheim, he argued that explanations of social interactions had to be made at the social level and not involve the wants and needs of individuals (Goldschmidt 1996). He defined the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1373883">function</span> of any recurrent activity as the part it plays in the social life as a whole, and thereby, the contribution it makes to structural continuity (Radcliffe-Brown 1952).</p><p id="import-auto-id1474050">Another noted structural functionalist, Robert Merton (1910&#8211;2003), pointed out that social processes often have many functions. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1409966">Manifest functions</span> are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated, while <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2747597">latent functions</span> are the unsought consequences of a social process. A manifest function of college education, for example, includes gaining knowledge, preparing for a career, and finding a good job that utilizes that education. Latent functions of your college years include meeting new people, participating in extracurricular activities, or even finding a spouse or partner. Another latent function of education is creating a hierarchy of employment based on the level of education attained. Latent functions can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2647607">dysfunctions</span>. In education, examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades, truancy, dropping out, not graduating, and not finding suitable employment.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1336318"><h2 data-type="title">Criticism</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id2648407">Structural-functionalism was the sociological paradigm that prevailed between World War II and the Vietnam War. Its influence declined in the 1960s and 1970s because many sociologists believed that it could not adequately explain the many rapid social changes taking place at the time. Many sociologists now believe that structural functionalism is no longer useful as a macro-level theory, but that it does serve as useful purpose in many mid-range analyses.</p>

      </span>
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1587798">Sociologists around the world are looking closely for signs of what would be an unprecedented event: the emergence of a global culture. In the past, empires such as those that existed in China, Europe, Africa, and Central and South America linked people from many different countries, but those people rarely became part of a common culture. They lived too far from each other, spoke different languages, practiced different religions, and traded few goods. Today, increases in communication, travel, and trade have made the world a much smaller place. More and more people are able to communicate with each other instantly&#8212;wherever they are located&#8212;by telephone, video, and text. They share movies, television shows, music, games, and information over the internet. Students can study with teachers and pupils from the other side of the globe. Governments find it harder to hide conditions inside their countries from the rest of the world.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1371542">Sociologists are researching many different aspects of this potential global culture. Some are exploring the dynamics involved in the social interactions of global online communities, such as when members feel a closer kinship to other group members than to people residing in their own country. Other sociologists are studying the impact this growing international culture has on smaller, less-powerful local cultures. Yet other researchers are exploring how international markets and the outsourcing of labor impact social inequalities. Sociology can play a key role in people's ability to understand the nature of this emerging global culture and how to respond to it.</p>

 <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id3081420"><h1 data-type="title">Conflict Theory</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id1016641">Another theory with a macro-level view, called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1814151">conflict theory</span>, looks at society as a competition for limited resources. Conflict theory sees society as being made up of individuals who must compete for social, political, and material resources such as political power, leisure time, money, housing, and entertainment. Social structures and organizations such as religious groups, governments, and corporations reflect this competition in their inherent inequalities. Some individuals and organizations are able to obtain and keep more resources than others. These "winners" use their power and influence to maintain their positions of power in society and to suppress the advancement of other individuals and groups. Of the early founders of sociology, Karl Marx is most closely identified with this theory. He focused on the economic conflict between different social classes. As he and Fredrick Engels famously described in their <em data-effect="italics">Communist Manifesto</em>, &#8220;the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed&#8221; (1848).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1506994">Developing on this foundation, Polish-Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838&#8211;1909) expanded on Marx&#8217;s ideas to develop his own version of conflict theory, adding his knowledge about how civilizations evolve. In <em data-effect="italics">Outlines of Sociology</em> (1884), he argues that war and conquest are the basis on which civilizations have been shaped. He believed that cultural and ethnic conflicts led to states being identified and defined by a dominant group that had power over other groups (Irving 2007).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2622526">The German sociologist Max Weber agreed with Marx that the economic inequalities of the capitalist system were a source of widespread conflict. However, he disagreed that the conflict must lead to revolution and the collapse of capitalism. Weber theorized that there was more than one cause for conflict: besides economics, inequalities could exist over political power and social status. The level of inequalities could also be different for different groups based on education, race, or gender. As long as these conflicts remained separate, the system as a whole was not threatened.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1310025">Weber also identified several factors that moderated people's reaction to inequality. If the authority of the people in power was considered legitimate by those over whom they had power, then conflicts were less intense. Other moderating factors were high rates of social mobility and low rates of class difference.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1663502">Another German sociologist, Georg Simmel (1858&#8211;1918), wrote that conflict can in fact help integrate and stabilize a society. Like Weber, Simmel said that the nature of social conflict was highly variable. The intensity and violence of the conflict depended upon the emotional involvement of the different sides, the degree of solidarity among the opposing groups, and if there were clear and limited goals to be achieved. Simmel also said that frequent smaller conflicts would be less violent than a few large conflicts.</p><p id="import-auto-id2106970">Simmel also studied how conflict changes the parties involved. He showed that groups work to increase their internal solidarity, centralize power, reduce dissent, and become less tolerant of those not in the group during conflict. Resolving conflicts can release tension and hostility and pave the way for future agreements.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2195437">More recently, conflict theory has been used to explain inequalities between groups based on gender or race. Janet Saltzman Chafetz (1941&#8211;2006) was a leader in the field of feminist conflict theory. Her books <em data-effect="italics">Masculine/Feminine or Human</em> (1974), <em data-effect="italics">Feminist Sociology</em> (1988), and <em data-effect="italics">Gender Equity</em> (1990) and other studies Dr. Chafetz uses conflict theory to present a set of models to explain the forces maintaining a system of gender inequality as well as a theory of how such a system can be changed. She argues that two types of forces sustain a system of gender inequality. One type of force is coercive and is based on the advantages men have in finding, keeping, and advancing in positions within the workforce. The other depends on the voluntary choices individuals make based on the gender roles that have been passed down through their families. Chafetz argues that the system can be changed through changes in the number and types of jobs available to increasingly large numbers of well-educated women entering the workforce (Turner 2003).</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2682496"><h2 data-type="title">Criticism</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id1291216">Just as structural functionalism was criticized for focusing too much on the stability of societies, conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability. Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id2651699">The consumption of food is a commonplace, daily occurrence, yet it can also be associated with important moments in our lives. Eating can be an individual or a group action, and eating habits and customs are influenced by our cultures. In the context of society, our nation&#8217;s food system is at the core of numerous social movements, political issues, and economic debates. Any of these factors might become a topic of sociological study.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1681691">A structural-functional approach to the topic of food consumption might be interested in the role of the agriculture industry within the nation&#8217;s economy and how this has changed from the early days of manual-labor farming to modern mechanized production. Another examination might study the different functions that occur in food production: from farming and harvesting to flashy packaging and mass consumerism.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1682883">A conflict theorist might be interested in the power differentials present in the regulation of food, exploring where people&#8217;s right to information intersects with corporations&#8217; drive for profit and how the government mediates those interests. Or a conflict theorist might be interested in the power and powerlessness experienced by local farmers versus large farming conglomerates, such as the documentary <em data-effect="italics">Food Inc.</em> depicts as resulting from Monsanto&#8217;s patenting of seed technology. Another topic of study might be how nutrition varies between different social classes.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id834520">A sociologist viewing food consumption through a symbolic interactionist lens would be more interested in micro-level topics, such as the symbolic use of food in religious rituals, or the role it plays in the social interaction of a family dinner. This perspective might also study the interactions among group members who identify themselves based on their sharing a particular diet, such as vegetarians (people who don&#8217;t eat meat) or locavores (people who strive to eat locally produced food).</p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2109775"><h1 data-type="title">Symbolic InteractionistTheory</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id2269321"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2621869">Symbolic Interactionism</span> provides a theoretical perspective that helps scholars examine the relationship of individuals within their society. This perspective is centered on the notion that communication&#8212;or the exchange of meaning through language and symbols&#8212;is how people make sense of their social worlds. As pointed out by Herman and Reynolds (1994), this viewpoint sees people as active in shaping their world, rather than as entities who are acted upon by society (Herman and Reynolds 1994). This approach looks at society and people from a micro-level perspective.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1409083">George Herbert Mead (1863&#8211;1931) is considered one of the founders of symbolic interactionism, though he never published his work on it (LaRossa &amp; Reitzes 1993). It was up to his student Herbert Blumer (1900&#8211;1987) to interpret Mead's work and popularize the theory. Blumer coined the term &#8220;symbolic interactionism&#8221; and identified its three basic premises:</p>
    <ol id="eip-277" data-number-style="arabic"><li>Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.</li>
<li>The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society.</li>
<li>These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters (Blumer 1969).</li></ol><p id="import-auto-id2101681">Social scientists who apply symbolic-interactionist thinking look for patterns of interaction between individuals. Their studies often involve observation of one-on-one interactions. For example, while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference, a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact, as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message. The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman (1922-1982) to develop a technique called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1428912">dramaturgical analysis</span>. Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people&#8217;s interactions showed patterns of cultural &#8220;scripts.&#8221; Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation, he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds (Goffman 1958).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2101043">Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods, such as in-depth interviews or participant observation, because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live. </p>
    <section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1329337"><h2 data-type="title">Criticism</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id1306677">Research done from this perspective is often scrutinized because of the difficulty of remaining objective. Others criticize the extremely narrow focus on symbolic interaction. Proponents, of course, consider this one of its greatest strengths.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id1487034">Sociologists develop theories to explain social events, interactions, and patterns. A theory is a proposed explanation of those patterns. Theories have different scales. Macro-level theories, such as structural functionalism and conflict theory, attempt to explain how societies operate as a whole. Micro-level theories, such as symbolic interactionism, focus on interactions between individuals.</p>

  </span></figure><p id="import-auto-id1625960">When Elizabeth Eckford tried to enter Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in September 1957, she was met by an angry crowd. But she knew she had the law on her side. Three years earlier in the landmark <em data-effect="italics">Brown vs. the Board of Education</em> case, the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned 21 state laws that allowed blacks and whites to be taught in separate school systems as long as the school systems were &#8220;equal.&#8221; One of the major factors influencing that decision was research conducted by the husband-and-wife team of sociologists, Kenneth and Mamie Clark. Their research showed that segregation was harmful to young black schoolchildren, and the Court found that harm to be unconstitutional.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1931784">Since it was first founded, many people interested in sociology have been driven by the scholarly desire to contribute knowledge to this field, while others have seen it as way not only to study society, but also to improve it. Besides desegregation, sociology has played a crucial role in many important social reforms such as equal opportunity for women in the workplace, improved treatment for individuals with mental handicaps or learning disabilities, increased accessibility and accommodation for people with physical handicaps, the right of native populations to preserve their land and culture, and prison system reforms.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2678868">The prominent sociologist Peter L. Berger (1929&#8211; ), in his 1963 book <em data-effect="italics">Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective</em>, describes a sociologist as "someone concerned with understanding society in a disciplined way." He asserts that sociologists have a natural interest in the monumental moments of people&#8217;s lives, as well as a fascination with banal, everyday occurrences. Berger also describes the &#8220;aha&#8221; moment when a sociological theory becomes applicable and understood:</p>
   <p id="fs-id1165298831724"> <blockquote id="import-auto-id1426759">[T]here is a deceptive simplicity and obviousness about some sociological investigations. One reads them, nods at the familiar scene, remarks that one has heard all this before and don't people have better things to do than to waste their time on truisms&#8212;until one is suddenly brought up against an insight that radically questions everything one had previously assumed about this familiar scene. This is the point at which one begins to sense the excitement of sociology. (Berger 1963)</blockquote></p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1363149">Sociology can be exciting because it teaches people ways to recognize how they fit into the world and how others perceive them. Looking at themselves and society from a sociological perspective helps people see where they connect to different groups based on the many different ways they classify themselves and how society classifies them in turn. It raises awareness of how those classifications&#8212;such as economic and status levels, education, ethnicity, or sexual orientation&#8212;affect perceptions.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1455010">Sociology teaches people not to accept easy explanations. It teaches them a way to organize their thinking so that they can ask better questions and formulate better answers. It makes people more aware that there are many different kinds of people in the world who do not necessarily think the way they do. It increases their willingness and ability to try to see the world from other people's perspectives. This prepares them to live and work in an increasingly diverse and integrated world.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id2337377">Sociology prepares people for a wide variety of careers. Besides actually conducting social research or training others in the field, people who graduate from college with a degree in sociology are hired by government agencies and corporations in fields such as social services, counseling (e.g., family planning, career, substance abuse), community planning, health services, marketing, market research, and human resources. Even a small amount of training in sociology can be an asset in careers like sales, public relations, journalism, teaching, law, and criminal justice.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id2081192">The phenomenon known as Facebook was designed specifically for students. Whereas earlier generations wrote notes in each other&#8217;s printed yearbooks at the end of the academic year, modern technology and the internet ushered in dynamic new ways for people to interact socially. Instead of having to meet up on campus, students can call, text, and Skype from their dorm rooms. Instead of a study group gathering weekly in the library, online forums and chat rooms help learners connect. The availability and immediacy of computer technology has forever changed the ways students engage with each other.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2826522">Now, after several social networks have vied for primacy, a few have established their place in the market and some have attracted niche audience. While Facebook launched the social networking trend geared toward teens and young adults, now people of all ages are actively &#8220;friending&#8221; each other. LinkedIn distinguished itself by focusing on professional connections, serving as a virtual world for workplace networking. Newer offshoots like Foursquare help people connect based on the real-world places they frequent, while Twitter has cornered the market on brevity.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1588516">These newer modes of social interaction have also spawned harmful consequences, such as cyberbullying and what some call FAD, or Facebook Addiction Disorder. Researchers have also examined other potential negative impacts, such as whether Facebooking lowers a student&#8217;s GPA, or whether there might be long-term effects of replacing face-to-face interaction with social media.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2194756">All of these social networks demonstrate emerging ways that people interact, whether positive or negative. They illustrate how sociological topics are alive and changing today. Social media will most certainly be a developing topic in the study of sociology for decades to come.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id1779190">Studying sociology is beneficial both for the individual and for society. By studying sociology people learn how to think critically about social issues and problems that confront our society. The study of sociology enriches students&#8217; lives and prepares them for careers in an increasingly diverse world. Society benefits because people with sociological training are better prepared to make informed decisions about social issues and take effective action to deal with them.</p>

        <p id="import-auto-id2886676">In the campus cafeteria, you set your lunch tray down at a table, grab a chair, join a group of your college classmates, and hear the start of two discussions. One person says, &#8220;It&#8217;s weird how Jimmy Buffett has so many devoted fans.&#8221; Another says, &#8220;Disney World is packed year-round.&#8221; Those two seemingly benign statements are claims, or opinions, based on everyday observation of human behavior. Perhaps the speakers had firsthand experience, talked to experts, conducted online research, or saw news segments on TV. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2818960">In response, two conversations erupt.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1304176">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why anyone would want to go to Disney World and stand in those long lines.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2696956">&#8220;Are you kidding?! Going to Disney World is one of my favorite childhood memories.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1490401">&#8220;It&#8217;s the opposite for me with Jimmy Buffett. After seeing one of his shows, I don&#8217;t need to go again.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2104489">&#8220;Yet some people make it a lifestyle.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1497625">&#8220;A theme park is way different than a concert.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1254908">&#8220;But both are places people go for the same thing: a good time.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id3593631">&#8220;If you call getting lost in a crowd of thousands of strangers fun.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id3035787">As your classmates at the lunch table discuss what they know or believe, the two topics converge. The conversation becomes a debate. Someone compares Parrotheads to Packers fans. Someone else compares Disney World to a cruise. Students take sides, agreeing or disagreeing, as the conversation veers to topics such as crowd control, mob mentality, political protests, and group dynamics. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1318097">If you contributed your expanding knowledge of sociological research to this conversation, you might make statements like these: </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id852744">&#8220;Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s fans long for escapism. Parrotheads join together claiming they want freedom, except they only want a temporary escape.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1450834">And this: &#8220;Mickey Mouse is a symbol of America just like the Statue of Liberty. Disney World is a place where families go to celebrate what they see as America.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1873842">You finish lunch, clear away your tray, and hurry to your next class. But you are thinking of Jimmy Buffett and Disney World. You have a new perspective on human behavior and a list of questions that you want answered. That is the purpose of sociological research&#8212;to investigate and provide insights into how human societies function. Although claims and opinions are part of sociology, sociologists use <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1669502">empirical evidence</span> (that is, evidence corroborated by direct experience and/or observation) combined with the scientific method or an interpretive framework to deliver sound sociological research. They also rely on a theoretical foundation that provides an interpretive perspective through which they can make sense of scientific results.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1750854">A truly scientific sociological study of the social situations up for discussion in the cafeteria would involve these prescribed steps: defining a specific question, gathering information and resources through observation, forming a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis in a reproducible manner, analyzing and drawing conclusions from the data, publishing the results, and anticipating further development when future researchers respond to and retest findings. An appropriate starting point in this case might be the question "What do fans of Jimmy Buffett seek that drives them to attend his concerts faithfully?" </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1869527">As you begin to think like a sociologist, you may notice that you have tapped into your observation skills. You might assume that your observations and insights are valuable and accurate. But the results of casual observation are limited by the fact that there is no standardization&#8212;who is to say one person&#8217;s observation of an event is any more accurate than another&#8217;s? To mediate these concerns, sociologists rely on systematic research processes.</p>

</ul></div>
        <p id="import-auto-id1295828">When sociologists apply the sociological perspective and begin to ask questions, no topic is off limits. Every aspect of human behavior is a source of possible investigation. Sociologists question the world that humans have created and live in. They notice patterns of behavior as people move through that world. Using sociological methods and systematic research within the framework of the scientific method and a scholarly interpretive perspective, sociologists have discovered workplace patterns that have transformed industries, family patterns that have enlightened parents, and education patterns that have aided structural changes in classrooms. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2911374">The students at that college cafeteria discussion put forth a few loosely stated opinions. If the human behaviors around those claims were tested systematically, a student could write a report and offer the findings to fellow sociologists and the world in general. The new perspective could help people understand themselves and their neighbors and help people make better decisions about their lives. It might seem strange to use scientific practices to study social trends, but, as we shall see, it&#8217;s extremely helpful to rely on systematic approaches that research methods provide. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1347539">Sociologists often begin the research process by asking a question about how or why things happen in this world. It might be a unique question about a new trend or an old question about a common aspect of life. Once a question is formed, a sociologist proceeds through an in-depth process to answer it. In deciding how to design that process, the researcher may adopt a scientific approach or an interpretive framework. The following sections describe these approaches to knowledge.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169033120809"><h1 data-type="title">The Scientific Method</h1>
        <p id="import-auto-id2351476">Sociologists make use of tried and true methods of research, such as experiments, surveys, and field research. But humans and their social interactions are so diverse that they can seem impossible to chart or explain. It might seem that science is about discoveries and chemical reactions or about proving ideas right or wrong rather than about exploring the nuances of human behavior.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2039636">However, this is exactly why scientific models work for studying human behavior. A scientific process of research establishes parameters that help make sure results are objective and accurate. Scientific methods provide limitations and boundaries that focus a study and organize its results.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1489616">The scientific method involves developing and testing theories about the world based on empirical evidence. It is defined by its commitment to systematic observation of the empirical world and strives to be objective, critical, skeptical, and logical. It involves a series of prescribed steps that have been established over centuries of scholarship.</p>
<figure id="fs-id2638333"><figcaption>The scientific method is an essential tool in research.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1409912" data-alt="The figure shows a flowchart that states the scientific method.

One: Ask a Question. Two: Research Existing Sources. Three: Formulate a Hypothesis. Four: Design and Conduct a Study. Five: Draw Conclusions. Six: Report Results." width="225"/>
</span>

</figure><p id="import-auto-id1873453">But just because sociological studies use scientific methods does not make the results less human. Sociological topics are not reduced to right or wrong facts. In this field, results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before&#8212;knowledge of other cultures, knowledge of rituals and beliefs, knowledge of trends and attitudes. No matter what research approach is used, researchers want to maximize the study&#8217;s <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1203598">reliability</span> (how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced). Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group. Researchers also strive for <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1344671">validity</span>, which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure. Returning to the Disney World topic, reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average experience of theme park-goers. Validity would ensure that the study&#8217;s design accurately examined what it was designed to study, so an exploration of adults&#8217; interactions with costumed mascots should address that issue and not veer into other age groups&#8217; interactions with them or into adult interactions with staff or other guests. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1750499">In general, sociologists tackle questions about the role of social characteristics in outcomes. For example, how do different communities fare in terms of psychological well-being, community cohesiveness, range of vocation, wealth, crime rates, and so on? Are communities functioning smoothly? Sociologists look between the cracks to discover obstacles to meeting basic human needs. They might study environmental influences and patterns of behavior that lead to crime, substance abuse, divorce, poverty, unplanned pregnancies, or illness. And, because sociological studies are not all focused on negative behaviors or challenging situations, researchers might study vacation trends, healthy eating habits, neighborhood organizations, higher education patterns, games, parks, and exercise habits.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2618900"> Sociologists can use the scientific method not only to collect but to interpret and analyze the data. They deliberately apply scientific logic and objectivity. They are interested in but not attached to the results. They work outside of their own political or social agenda. This doesn&#8217;t mean researchers do not have their own personalities, complete with preferences and opinions. But sociologists deliberately use the scientific method to maintain as much objectivity, focus, and consistency as possible in a particular study.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1665220">With its systematic approach, the scientific method has proven useful in shaping sociological studies. The scientific method provides a systematic, organized series of steps that help ensure objectivity and consistency in exploring a social problem. They provide the means for accuracy, reliability, and validity. In the end, the scientific method provides a shared basis for discussion and analysis (Merton 1963).</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2674434">Typically, the scientific method starts with these steps&#8212;1) ask a question, 2) research existing sources, 3) formulate a hypothesis&#8212;described below. </p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033135167"><h2 data-type="title">Ask a Question</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1344280">The first step of the scientific method is to ask a question, describe a problem, and identify the specific area of interest. The topic should be narrow enough to study within a geography and timeframe. &#8220;Are societies capable of sustained happiness?&#8221; would be too vague. The question should also be broad enough to have universal merit. &#8220;What do personal hygiene habits reveal about the values of students at XYZ High School?&#8221; would be too narrow. That said, happiness and hygiene are worthy topics to study. Sociologists do not rule out any topic, but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2021131">That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms. In a hygiene study, for instance, hygiene could be defined as &#8220;personal habits to maintain physical appearance (as opposed to health),&#8221; and a researcher might ask, &#8220;How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance?&#8221; When forming these basic research questions, sociologists develop an <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1301566">operational definition</span>, that is, they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it. The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept. By operationalizing a variable of the concept, all researchers can collect data in a systematic or replicable manner.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1325342">The operational definition must be valid, appropriate, and meaningful. And it must be reliable, meaning that results will be close to uniform when tested on more than one person. For example, &#8220;good drivers&#8221; might be defined in many ways: those who use their turn signals, those who don&#8217;t speed, or those who courteously allow others to merge. But these driving behaviors could be interpreted differently by different researchers and could be difficult to measure. Alternatively, &#8220;a driver who has never received a traffic violation&#8221; is a specific description that will lead researchers to obtain the same information, so it is an effective operational definition. </p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033159588"><h2 data-type="title">Research Existing Sources</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1759367">The next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2733064">literature review</span>, which is a review of any existing similar or related studies. A visit to the library and a thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study. This step helps researchers gain a broad understanding of work previously conducted on the topic at hand and enables them to position their own research to build on prior knowledge. Researchers&#8212;including student researchers&#8212;are responsible for correctly citing existing sources they use in a study or that inform their work. While it is fine to borrow previously published material (as long as it enhances a unique viewpoint), it must be referenced properly and never plagiarized.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1188650">To study hygiene and its value in a particular society, a researcher might sort through existing research and unearth studies about child-rearing, vanity, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and cultural attitudes toward beauty. It&#8217;s important to sift through this information and determine what is relevant. Using existing sources educates a researcher and helps refine and improve a study&#8217;s design.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033105588"><h2 data-type="title">Formulate a Hypothesis</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1240914">A <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2217888">hypothesis</span> is an assumption about how two or more variables are related; it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables. In sociology, the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another. In research, <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2875832">independent variables</span> are the <em data-effect="italics">cause</em> of the change. The <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1372836">dependent variable</span> is the <em data-effect="italics">effect</em>, or thing that is changed.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1903899">For example, in a basic study, the researcher would establish one form of human behavior as the independent variable and observe the influence it has on a dependent variable. How does gender (the independent variable) affect rate of income (the dependent variable)? How does one&#8217;s religion (the independent variable) affect family size (the dependent variable)? How is social class (the dependent variable) affected by level of education (the independent variable)?</p>

</tbody></table><p id="import-auto-id2324649">At this point, a researcher&#8217;s operational definitions help measure the variables. In a study asking how tutoring improves grades, for instance, one researcher might define &#8220;good&#8221; grades as a C or better, while another uses a B+ as a starting point for &#8220;good.&#8221; Another operational definition might describe &#8220;tutoring&#8221; as &#8220;one-on-one assistance by an expert in the field, hired by an educational institution.&#8221; Those definitions set limits and establish cut-off points, ensuring consistency and replicability in a study. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2185229">As the chart shows, an independent variable is the one that causes a dependent variable to change. For example, a researcher might hypothesize that teaching children proper hygiene (the independent variable) will boost their sense of self-esteem (the dependent variable). Or rephrased, a child&#8217;s sense of self-esteem depends, in part, on the quality and availability of  hygienic resources.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1361826">Of course, this hypothesis can also work the other way around. Perhaps a sociologist believes that increasing a child&#8217;s sense of self-esteem (the independent variable) will automatically increase or improve habits of hygiene (now the dependent variable). Identifying the independent and dependent variables is very important. As the hygiene example shows, simply identifying two topics, or variables, is not enough: Their prospective relationship must be part of the hypothesis. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2620168">Just because a sociologist forms an educated prediction of a study&#8217;s outcome doesn&#8217;t mean data contradicting the hypothesis aren&#8217;t welcome. Sociologists analyze general patterns in response to a study, but they are equally interested in exceptions to patterns. In a study of education, a researcher might predict that high school dropouts have a hard time finding a rewarding career. While it has become at least a cultural assumption that the higher the education, the higher the salary and degree of career happiness, there are certainly exceptions. People with little education have had stunning careers, and people with advanced degrees have had trouble finding work. A sociologist prepares a hypothesis knowing that results will vary.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1494060">Once the preliminary work is done, it&#8217;s time for the next research steps: designing and conducting a study, and drawing conclusions. These research methods are discussed below.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169033103160"><h1 data-type="title">Interpretive Framework</h1>
        <p id="import-auto-id2768819">While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach, others operate from an <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2731490">interpretive framework</span>. While systematic, this approach doesn&#8217;t follow the hypothesis-testing model that seeks to find generalizable results. Instead, an <em data-effect="italics">interpretive framework</em>, sometimes referred to as an interpretive perspective, seeks to understand social worlds from the point of view of participants, leading to in-depth knowledge. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2839601">Interpretive research is generally more descriptive or narrative in its findings. Rather than formulating a hypothesis and method for testing it, an interpretive researcher will develop approaches to explore the topic at hand that may involve lots of direct observation or interaction with subjects. This type of researcher also learns as he or she proceeds, sometimes adjusting the research methods or processes midway to optimize findings as they evolve.</p>

        <p id="import-auto-id2853619">Using the scientific method, a researcher conducts a study in five phases: asking a question, researching existing sources, formulating a hypothesis, conducting a study, and drawing conclusions. The scientific method is useful in that it provides a clear method of organizing a study. Some sociologists conduct research through an interpretive framework rather than employing the scientific method.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2691736">Scientific sociological studies often observe relationships between variables. Researchers study how one variable changes another. Prior to conducting a study, researchers are careful to apply operational definitions to their terms and to establish dependent and independent variables.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id1354118">Sociologists examine the world, see a problem or interesting pattern, and set out to study it. They use research methods to design a study&#8212;perhaps a detailed, systematic, scientific method for conducting research and obtaining data, or perhaps an ethnographic study utilizing an interpretive framework. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1652214">When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn&#8217;t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, &#8220;Any gang members around?&#8221; And if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency, the self-conscious, intimidated baristas might not behave naturally.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id3035801">In the 1920s, leaders of a Chicago factory called Hawthorne Works commissioned a study to determine whether or not lighting could increase or decrease worker productivity. Sociologists were brought in. Changes were made. Productivity increased. Results were published.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2649837">But when the study was over, productivity dropped again. Why did this happen? In 1953, Henry A. Landsberger analyzed the study results to answer this question. He realized that employee productivity increased because sociologists were paying attention to them. The sociologists&#8217; presence influenced the study results. Worker behaviors were altered not by the lighting but by the study itself. From this, sociologists learned the importance of carefully planning their roles as part of their research design (Franke and Kaul 1978).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2329183">Landsberger called the workers&#8217; response the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2082778">Hawthorne effect</span>&#8212;people  changing their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study. The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research. In many cases, sociologists have to make the purpose of the study known. Subjects must be aware that they are being observed, and a certain amount of artificiality may result (Sonnenfeld 1985).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2352781">Making sociologists&#8217; presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can&#8217;t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors. In situations like these, other methods are needed. All studies shape the research design, while research design simultaneously shapes the study. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topic and that fit with their overall approach to research. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2774799">In planning a study&#8217;s design, sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation: survey, field research, experiment, and secondary data analysis (or use of existing sources). Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1354839"><h1 data-type="title">Surveys</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id1461933">As a research method, a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2039965">survey</span> collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.</p>
    <figure id="import-auto-id2621394"><figcaption>Questionnaires are a common research method; the U.S. Census is a well-known example. (Photo courtesy of Karen Horton/flickr)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id1352828" data-alt="An image of a portion of a questionnaire is shown.">
        <img src="/resources/cbc6e04b147f9481db079a4867cc1bc40450fcae/Figure_02_02_01.jpg" data-media-type="image/png" alt="An image of a portion of a questionnaire is shown." width="350"/>
      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1382153">At some point or another, everyone responds to some type of survey. The United States Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Customers fill out questionnaires at stores or promotional events, responding to questions such as &#8220;How did you hear about the event?&#8221; and &#8220;Were the staff helpful?&#8221; You&#8217;ve probably picked up the phone and heard a caller ask you to participate in a political poll or similar type of survey. &#8220;Do you eat hot dogs? If yes, how many per month?&#8221; </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2687105">Not all surveys would be considered sociological research. Marketing polls help companies refine marketing goals and strategies; they are generally not conducted as part of a scientific study, meaning they are not designed to test a hypothesis or to contribute knowledge to the field of sociology. The results are not published in a refereed scholarly journal, where design, methodology, results, and analyses are vetted. Often, polls on TV do not reflect a general population, but are merely answers from a specific show&#8217;s audience. Polls conducted by programs such as <em data-effect="italics">American Idol</em> or <em data-effect="italics">So You Think You Can Dance</em> represent the opinions of fans but are not particularly scientific. A good contrast to these are the Nielsen Ratings, which determine the popularity of television programming through scientific market research. </p>

      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1339070">Sociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel and think&#8212;or at least how they say they feel and think. Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits), or factual information such as employment status, income, and education levels. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2744408">A survey targets a specific <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2269226">population</span>, people who are the focus of a study, such as college athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1213338">sample</span>: that is, a manageable number of subjects who <em data-effect="italics">represent</em> a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample. In a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1305852">random sample</span>, every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study. According to the laws of probability, random samples represent the population as a whole. For instance, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or 10,000 people.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id934355">After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the study up front. If they agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, a means of gathering the information. A common instrument is a questionnaire, in which subjects answer a series of questions. For some topics, the researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question. This kind of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id787317">quantitative data</span>&#8212;research collected in numerical form that can be counted&#8212;are easy to tabulate. Just count up the number of &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; responses or correct answers and chart them into percentages.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2276505">Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers&#8212;beyond &#8220;yes,&#8221; &#8220;no,&#8221; or the option next to a checkbox. In those cases, the answers are subjective, varying from person to person. <em data-effect="italics">How do plan to use your college education? Why do you follow Jimmy Buffett around the country and attend every concert?</em> Those types of questions require short essay responses, and participants willing to take the time to write those answers will convey personal information about religious beliefs, political views, and morals. Some topics that reflect internal thought are impossible to observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of information is <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id781099">qualitative data</span>&#8212;results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting. Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of material that they provide.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1449759">An <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2100841">interview</span> is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and is a way of conducting surveys on a topic. Interviews are similar to the short answer questions on surveys in that the researcher asks subjects a series of questions. However, participants are free to respond as they wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the questions honestly. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2198132">Questions such as &#8220;How did society's view of alcohol consumption influence your decision whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?&#8221; or &#8220;Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would put a social stigma on your family?&#8221; involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize. A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise, the results will prove to be unreliable. And, obviously, a sociological interview is not an interrogation. The researcher will benefit from gaining a subject&#8217;s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a subject, and from listening without judgment.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1406732"><h1 data-type="title">Field Research</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id2325088">The work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Sociologists seldom study subjects in their own offices or laboratories. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where they live, work, and play. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2228580">Field research</span> refers to gathering <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2286984">primary data</span> from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey. It is a research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1385103">The researcher interacts with or observes a person or people, gathering data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject&#8217;s natural environment, whether it&#8217;s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.</p>

      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1317622">While field research often begins in a specific <em data-effect="italics">setting</em>, the study&#8217;s purpose is to observe specific <em data-effect="italics">behaviors</em> in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing <em data-effect="italics">how</em> people behave. It is less useful, however, for understanding <em data-effect="italics">why</em> they behave that way. You can't really narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2870770">Much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2858919">correlation</span>. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables.</p>

    </figure><p id="import-auto-id2884922">Some sociologists study small groups of people who share an identity in one aspect of their lives. Almost everyone belongs to a group of like-minded people who share an interest or hobby. Scientologists, folk dancers, or members of Mensa (an organization for people with exceptionally high IQs) express a specific part of their identity through their affiliation with a group. Those groups are often of great interest to sociologists.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1685553">Jimmy Buffett, an American musician who built a career from his single top-10 song &#8220;Margaritaville,&#8221; has a following of devoted groupies called Parrotheads. Some of them have taken fandom to the extreme, making Parrothead culture a lifestyle. In 2005, Parrotheads and their subculture caught the attention of researchers John Mihelich and John Papineau. The two saw the way Jimmy Buffett fans collectively created an artificial reality. They wanted to know how fan groups shape culture. The result was a study and resulting article called &#8220;Parrotheads in Margaritaville: Fan Practice, Oppositional Culture, and Embedded Cultural Resistance in Buffett Fandom.&#8221;</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1487080">What Mihelich and Papineau found was that Parrotheads, for the most part, do not seek to challenge or even change society, as many sub-groups do. In fact, most Parrotheads live successfully within society, holding upper-level jobs in the corporate world. What they seek is escape from the stress of daily life. They get it from Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s concerts and from the public image he projects. Buffett fans collectively keep their version of an alternate reality alive.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1375388">At Jimmy Buffett concerts, Parrotheads engage in a form of role play. They paint their faces and dress for the tropics in grass skirts, Hawaiian leis, and Parrot hats. These fans don&#8217;t generally play the part of Parrotheads outside of these concerts; you are not likely to see a lone Parrothead in a bank or library. In that sense, Parrothead culture is less about individualism and more about conformity. Being a Parrothead means sharing a specific identity. Parrotheads feel connected to each other: it&#8217;s a group identity, not an individual one.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1251916">On fan websites, followers conduct polls calling for responses to message-board prompts such as &#8220;Why are you a Parrothead&#8221; and &#8220;Where is your Margaritaville?&#8221; To the latter question, fans define the place as anywhere from a beach to a bar to a peaceful state of mind. Ultimately, however, &#8220;Margaritaville&#8221; is an imaginary place.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1498419">In their study, Mihelich and Papineau quote from a recent book by sociologist Richard Butsch, who writes, &#8220;un-self-conscious acts, if done by many people together, can produce change, even though the change may be unintended&#8221; (2000). Many Parrothead fan groups have performed good works in the name of Jimmy Buffett culture, donating to charities and volunteering their services.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1327987">However, the authors suggest that what really drives Parrothead culture is commercialism. Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s popularity was dying out in the 1980s until being reinvigorated after he signed a sponsorship deal with a beer company. These days, his concert tours alone generate nearly $30 million a year. Buffett made a lucrative career for himself by partnering with product companies and marketing Margaritaville in the form of T-shirts, restaurants, casinos, and an expansive line of products. Some fans accuse Buffett of selling out, while others admire his financial success. Buffett makes no secret of his commercial exploitations; from the stage, he&#8217;s been known to tell his fans, &#8220;Just remember, I am spending your money foolishly.&#8221;</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1196360">Mihelich and Papineau gathered much of their information online. Referring to their study as a &#8220;Web ethnography,&#8221; they collected extensive narrative material from fans who joined Parrothead clubs and posted their experiences on websites. &#8220;We do not claim to have conducted a complete ethnography of Parrothead fans, or even of the Parrothead Web activity,&#8221; state the authors, &#8220;but we focused on particular aspects of Parrothead practice as revealed through Web research&#8221; (2005). Fan narratives gave them insight into how individuals identify with Buffett&#8217;s world and how fans used popular music to cultivate personal and collective meaning.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1306033">In conducting studies about pockets of culture, most sociologists seek to discover a universal appeal. Mihelich and Papineau stated, &#8220;Although Parrotheads are a relative minority of the contemporary US population, an in-depth look at their practice and conditions illuminate [sic] cultural practices and conditions many of us experience and participate in&#8221; (2005).</p>
</div>
    <p id="import-auto-id1207465">Here, we will look at three types of field research: participant observation, ethnography, and the case study. </p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1387353"><h2 data-type="title">Participant Observation</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id1352744">In 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider&#8217;s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York &#8220;dot com&#8221; agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see if anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in <em data-effect="italics">The New Yorker</em> called &#8220;My Fake Job&#8221; (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and <em data-effect="italics">The New Yorker</em> issued an apology. However, Rothman&#8217;s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a &#8220;dot com&#8221; company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1490888">Rothman had conducted a form of study called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1652549">participant observation</span>, in which researchers join people and participate in a group&#8217;s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. Researchers temporarily put themselves into roles and record their observations. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, or live as a homeless person for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research. </p>
    <figure id="import-auto-id1450170"><figcaption>Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? (Photo courtesy of zoetnet/flickr)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id1148467" data-alt="Waitress serves customers in an outdoor caf&#233;.">
        <img src="/resources/3be175f5c3b42d22314a024c117bde6c47496e25/Figure_02_02_05.jpg" data-media-type="image/png" alt="Waitress serves customers in an outdoor caf&#233;." width="350"/>
      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1625886">At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: &#8220;What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?&#8221; or &#8220;What is it like to be homeless?&#8221; Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1183842">Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in shaping data into results.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2858593">In a study of small-town America conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in American towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised their purpose. This shaped the structure of <em data-effect="italics">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em>, their published results (Lynd and Lynd 1959).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1305474">The Lynds were upfront about their mission. The townspeople of Muncie, Indiana, knew why the researchers were in their midst. But some sociologists prefer not to alert people to their presence. The main advantage of covert participant observation is that it allows the researcher access to authentic, natural behaviors of a group&#8217;s members. The challenge, however, is gaining access to a setting without disrupting the pattern of others&#8217; behavior. Becoming an inside member of a group, organization, or subculture takes time and effort. Researchers must pretend to be something they are not. The process could involve role playing, making contacts, networking, or applying for a job.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1493765">Once inside a group, some researchers spend months or even years pretending to be one of the people they are observing. However, as observers, they cannot get too involved. They must keep their purpose in mind and apply the sociological perspective. That way, they illuminate social patterns that are often unrecognized. Because information gathered during participant observation is mostly qualitative, rather than quantitative, the end results are often descriptive or interpretive. The researcher might present findings in an article or book, describing what he or she witnessed and experienced.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2625012">This type of research is what journalist Barbara Ehrenreich conducted for her book <em data-effect="italics">Nickel and Dimed</em>. One day over lunch with her editor, as the story goes, Ehrenreich mentioned an idea. <em data-effect="italics">How can people exist on minimum-wage work? How do low-income workers get by?</em> she wondered. <em data-effect="italics">Someone should do a study.</em> To her surprise, her editor responded, <em data-effect="italics">Why don&#8217;t you do it?</em></p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1364464">That&#8217;s how Ehrenreich found herself joining the ranks of the working class. For several months, she left her comfortable home and lived and worked among people who lacked, for the most part, higher education and marketable job skills. Undercover, she applied for and worked minimum wage jobs as a waitress, a cleaning woman, a nursing home aide, and a retail chain employee. During her participant observation, she used only her income from those jobs to pay for food, clothing, transportation, and shelter.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2217754">She discovered the obvious, that it&#8217;s almost impossible to get by on minimum wage work. She also experienced and observed attitudes many middle and upper class people never think about. She witnessed firsthand the treatment of working class employees. She saw the extreme measures people take to make ends meet and to survive. She described fellow employees who held two or three jobs, worked seven days a week, lived in cars, could not pay to treat chronic health conditions, got randomly fired, submitted to drug tests, and moved in and out of homeless shelters. She brought aspects of that life to light, describing difficult working conditions and the poor treatment that low-wage workers suffer.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1496725"><em data-effect="italics">Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</em>, the book she wrote upon her return to her real life as a well-paid writer, has been widely read and used in many college classrooms. </p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2493828"><h2 data-type="title">Ethnography</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id787345"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id3016393">Ethnography</span> is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting. Ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1291492">The heart of an ethnographic study focuses on how subjects view their own social standing and how they understand themselves in relation to a community. An ethnographic study might observe, for example, a small American fishing town, an Inuit community, a village in Thailand, a Buddhist monastery, a private boarding school, or Disney World. These places all have borders. People live, work, study, or vacation within those borders. People are there for a certain reason and therefore behave in certain ways and respect certain cultural norms. An ethnographer would commit to spending a determined amount of time studying every aspect of the chosen place, taking in as much as possible.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1077166">A sociologist studying a tribe in the Amazon might watch the way villagers go about their daily lives and then write a paper about it. To observe a spiritual retreat center, an ethnographer might sign up for a retreat and attend as a guest for an extended stay, observe and record data, and collate the material into results.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1195314" class="note sociological-research" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">The Making of <em data-effect="italics">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em></div>
    <p id="import-auto-id1314707">In 1924, a young married couple named Robert and Helen Lynd undertook an unprecedented ethnography: to apply sociological methods to the study of one US city in order to discover what &#8220;ordinary&#8221; Americans did and believed. Choosing Muncie, Indiana (population about 30,000), as their subject, they moved to the small town and lived there for eighteen months.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2912315">Ethnographers had been examining other cultures for decades&#8212;groups considered minority or outsider&#8212;like gangs, immigrants, and the poor. But no one had studied the so-called average American.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1666671">Recording interviews and using surveys to gather data, the Lynds did not sugarcoat or idealize American life (PBS). They objectively stated what they observed. Researching existing sources, they compared Muncie in 1890 to the Muncie they observed in 1924. Most Muncie adults, they found, had grown up on farms but now lived in homes inside the city. From that discovery, the Lynds focused their study on the impact of industrialization and urbanization.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1396019">They observed that Muncie was divided into business class and working class groups. They defined business class as dealing with abstract concepts and symbols, while working class people used tools to create concrete objects. The two classes led different lives with different goals and hopes. However, the Lynds observed, mass production offered both classes the same amenities. Like wealthy families, the working class was now able to own radios, cars, washing machines, telephones, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators. This was an emerging material new reality of the 1920s. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1400392">As the Lynds worked, they divided their manuscript into six sections: Getting a Living, Making a Home, Training the Young, Using Leisure, Engaging in Religious Practices, and Engaging in Community Activities. Each chapter included subsections such as &#8220;The Long Arm of the Job&#8221; and &#8220;Why Do They Work So Hard?&#8221; in the &#8220;Getting a Living&#8221; chapter.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id787351">When the study was completed, the Lynds encountered a big problem. The Rockefeller Foundation, which had commissioned the book, claimed it was useless and refused to publish it. The Lynds asked if they could seek a publisher themselves.  </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1401009"><em data-effect="italics">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em> was not only published in 1929, but became an instant bestseller, a status unheard of for a sociological study. The book sold out six printings in its first year of publication, and has never gone out of print (PBS).</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1445258">Nothing like it had ever been done before. <em data-effect="italics">Middletown</em> was reviewed on the front page of the <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>. Readers in the 1920s and 1930s identified with the citizens of Muncie, Indiana, but they were equally fascinated by the sociological methods and the use of scientific data to define ordinary Americans. The book was proof that social data was important&#8212;and interesting&#8212;to the American public.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2691474"><h2 data-type="title">Case Study</h2>
    <p id="import-auto-id1375236">Sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event. A <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1394403">case study</span> is an in-depth analysis of a single event, situation, or individual. To conduct a case study, a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records, conducts interviews, engages in direct observation, and even participant observation, if possible.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2886528">Researchers might use this method to study a single case of, for example, a foster child, drug lord, cancer patient, criminal, or rape victim. However, a major criticism of the case study as a method is that a developed study of a single case, while offering depth on a topic, does not provide enough evidence to form a generalized conclusion. In other words, it is difficult to make universal claims based on just one person, since one person does not verify a pattern. This is why most sociologists do not use case studies as a primary research method.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2081192">However, case studies are useful when the single case is unique. In these instances, a single case study can add tremendous knowledge to a certain discipline. For example, a feral child, also called &#8220;wild child,&#8221; is one who grows up isolated from human beings. Feral children grow up without social contact and language, elements crucial to a &#8220;civilized&#8221; child&#8217;s development. These children mimic the behaviors and movements of animals, and often invent their own language. There are only about one hundred cases of &#8220;feral children&#8221; in the world. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1364432">As you may imagine, a feral child is a subject of great interest to researchers. Feral children provide unique information about child development because they have grown up outside of the parameters of &#8220;normal&#8221; child development. And since there are very few feral children, the case study is the most appropriate method for researchers to use in studying the subject. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1335118">At age 3, a Ukranian girl named Oxana Malaya suffered severe parental neglect. She lived in a shed with dogs, eating raw meat and scraps. Five years later, a neighbor called authorities and reported seeing a girl who ran on all fours, barking. Officials brought Oxana into society, where she was cared for and taught some human behaviors, but she never became fully socialized. She has been designated as unable to support herself and now lives in a mental institution (Grice 2011). Case studies like this offer a way for sociologists to collect data that may not be collectable by any other method.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2729111"><h1 data-type="title">Experiments</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id2347557">You&#8217;ve probably tested personal social theories. &#8220;If I study at night and review in the morning, I&#8217;ll improve my retention skills.&#8221; Or, &#8220;If I stop drinking soda, I&#8217;ll feel better.&#8221; Cause and effect. If this, then that. When you test the theory, your results either prove or disprove your hypothesis.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2686455">One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2864888">experiment</span>, meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis&#8212;a scientific approach.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1310502">There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments. In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that perhaps more data can be recorded in a certain amount of time. In a natural or field-based experiment, the generation of data cannot be controlled but the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or intervention by the researcher.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2105542">As a research method, either type of sociological experiment is useful for testing <em data-effect="italics">if-then</em> statements: <em data-effect="italics">if</em> a particular thing happens, <em data-effect="italics">then</em> another particular thing will result. To set up a lab-based experiment, sociologists create artificial situations that allow them to manipulate variables.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2738050">Classically, the sociologist selects a set of people with similar characteristics, such as age, class, race, or education. Those people are divided into two groups. One is the experimental group and the other is the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the independent variable(s) and the control group is not. To test the benefits of tutoring, for example, the sociologist might expose the experimental group of students to tutoring but not the control group. Then both groups would be tested for differences in performance to see if tutoring had an effect on the experimental group of students. As you can imagine, in a case like this, the researcher would not want to jeopardize the accomplishments of either group of students, so the setting would be somewhat artificial. The test would not be for a grade reflected on their permanent record, for example. </p>

      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id2926548">A real-life example will help illustrate the experiment process. In 1971, Frances Heussenstamm, a sociology professor at California State University at Los Angeles, had a theory about police prejudice. To test her theory she conducted an experiment. She chose fifteen students from three ethnic backgrounds: black, white, and Hispanic. She chose students who routinely drove to and from campus along Los Angeles freeway routes, and who&#8217;d had perfect driving records for longer than a year. Those were her independent variables&#8212;students, good driving records, same commute route.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id787236">Next, she placed a Black Panther bumper sticker on each car. That sticker, a representation of a social value, was the independent variable. In the 1970s, the Black Panthers were a revolutionary group actively fighting racism. Heussenstamm asked the students to follow their normal driving patterns. She wanted to see if seeming support of the Black Panthers would change how these good drivers were treated by the police patrolling the highways.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id925480">The first arrest, for an incorrect lane change, was made two hours after the experiment began. One participant was pulled over three times in three days. He quit the study. After seventeen days, the fifteen drivers had collected a total of thirty-three traffic citations. The experiment was halted. The funding to pay traffic fines had run out, and so had the enthusiasm of the participants (Heussenstamm 1971).</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1495781"><h1 data-type="title">Secondary Data Analysis</h1>
    <p id="import-auto-id1262175">While sociologists often engage in original research studies, they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through<span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2867777">secondary data analysis</span>. Secondary data don&#8217;t result from firsthand research collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers. Sociologists might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search through periodicals, newspapers, or magazines from any period in history.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1349578">Using available information not only saves time and money, but it can add depth to a study. Sociologists often interpret findings in a new way, a way that was not part of an author&#8217;s original purpose or intention. To study how women were encouraged to act and behave in the 1960s, for example, a researcher might watch movies, televisions shows, and situation comedies from that period. Or to research changes in behavior and attitudes due to the emergence of television in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a sociologist would rely on new interpretations of secondary data. Decades from now, researchers will most likely conduct similar studies on the advent of mobile phones, the Internet, or Facebook. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2876398">Social scientists also learn by analyzing the research of a variety of agencies. Governmental departments and global groups, like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or the World Health Organization, publish studies with findings that are useful to sociologists. A public statistic like the foreclosure rate might be useful for studying the effects of the 2008 recession; a racial demographic profile might be compared with data on education funding to examine the resources accessible by different groups.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id3111938">One of the advantages of secondary data is that it is <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1760983">nonreactive</span> (or unobtrusive) research, meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people&#8217;s behaviors. Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people, using previously published data doesn&#8217;t require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1359389">Using available data does have its challenges. Public records are not always easy to access. A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records. To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources, sociologists employ <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1975270">content analysis</span>, applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2012406">But, in some cases, there is no way to verify the accuracy of existing data. It is easy to count how many drunk drivers, for example, are pulled over by the police. But how many are not? While it&#8217;s possible to discover the percentage of teenage students who drop out of high school, it might be more challenging to determine the number who return to school or get their GED later. </p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1586998">Another problem arises when data are unavailable in the exact form needed or do not include the precise angle the researcher seeks. For example, the average salaries paid to professors at a public school is public record. But the separate figures don&#8217;t necessarily reveal how long it took each professor to reach the salary range, what their educational backgrounds are, or how long they&#8217;ve been teaching.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1334499">To write some of his books, sociologist Richard Sennett used secondary data to shed light on current trends. In <em data-effect="italics">The Craftsman</em> (2008), he studied the human desire to perform quality work, from carpentry to computer programming. He studied the line between craftsmanship and skilled manual labor. He also studied changes in attitudes toward craftsmanship that occurred not only during and after the Industrial Revolution, but also in ancient times. Obviously, he could not have firsthand knowledge of periods of ancient history; he had to rely on secondary data for part of his study.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2184254">When conducting content analysis, it is important to consider the date of publication of an existing source and to take into account attitudes and common cultural ideals that may have influenced the research. For example, Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd gathered research for their book <em data-effect="italics">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em> in the 1920s. Attitudes and cultural norms were vastly different then than they are now. Beliefs about gender roles, race, education, and work have changed significantly since then. At the time, the study&#8217;s purpose was to reveal the truth about small American communities. Today, it is an illustration of 1920s attitudes and values. </p>

    <p id="import-auto-id2738446">Sociological research is a fairly complex process. As you can see, a lot goes into even a simple research design. There are many steps and much to consider when collecting data on human behavior, as well as in interpreting and analyzing data in order to form conclusive results. Sociologists use scientific methods for good reason. The scientific method provides a system of organization that helps researchers plan and conduct the study while ensuring that data and results are reliable, valid, and objective.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id2856199">The many methods available to researchers&#8212;including experiments, surveys, field studies, and secondary data analysis&#8212;all come with advantages and disadvantages. The strength of a study can depend on the choice and implementation of the appropriate method of gathering research. Depending on the topic, a study might use a single method or a combination of methods. It is important to plan a research design before undertaking a study. The information gathered may in itself be surprising, and the study design should provide a solid framework in which to analyze predicted and unpredicted data.</p>

        <p id="import-auto-id1387478">Sociologists conduct studies to shed light on human behaviors. Knowledge is a powerful tool that can be used toward positive change. And while a sociologist&#8217;s goal is often simply to uncover knowledge rather than to spur action, many people use sociological studies to help improve people&#8217;s lives. In that sense, conducting a sociological study comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. Like any researchers, sociologists must consider their ethical obligation to avoid harming subjects or groups while conducting their research.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2774614">The American Sociological Association, or ASA, is the major professional organization of sociologists in North America. The ASA is a great resource for students of sociology as well. The ASA maintains a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1446197">code of ethics</span>&#8212;formal guidelines for conducting sociological research&#8212;consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline. It also describes procedures for filing, investigating, and resolving complaints of unethical conduct.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1407028">Practicing sociologists and sociology students have a lot to consider. Some of the guidelines state that researchers must try to be skillful and fair-minded in their work, especially as it relates to their human subjects. Researchers must obtain participants&#8217; informed consent, and inform subjects of the responsibilities and risks of research before they agree to partake. During a study, sociologists must ensure the safety of participants and immediately stop work if a subject becomes potentially endangered on any level. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1302898">Researchers are required to protect the privacy of research participants whenever possible. Even if pressured by authorities, such as police or courts, researchers are not ethically allowed to release confidential information. Researchers must make results available to other sociologists, must make public all sources of financial support, and must not accept funding from any organization that might cause a conflict of interest or seek to influence the research results for its own purposes. The ASA&#8217;s ethical considerations shape not only the study but also the publication of results. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1298892">Pioneer German sociologist Max Weber (1864&#8211;1920) identified another crucial ethical concern. Weber understood that personal values could distort the framework for disclosing study results. While he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values, he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses. Sociologists, he stated, must establish <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1975193">value neutrality</span>, a practice of remaining impartial, without bias or judgment, during the course of a study and in publishing results (1949). Sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1261487">Is value neutrality possible? Many sociologists believe it is impossible to set aside personal values and retain complete objectivity. They caution readers, rather, to understand that sociological studies may, by necessity, contain a certain amount of value bias. It does not discredit the results but allows readers to view them as one form of truth rather than a singular fact. Some sociologists attempt to remain uncritical and as objective as possible when studying cultural institutions. Value neutrality does not mean having no opinions. It means striving to overcome personal biases, particularly subconscious biases, when analyzing data. It means avoiding skewing data in order to match a predetermined outcome that aligns with a particular agenda, such as a political or moral point of view. Investigators are ethically obligated to report results, even when they contradict personal views, predicted outcomes, or widely accepted beliefs.</p>

        <p id="import-auto-id1344919">Sociologists and sociology students must take ethical responsibility for any study they conduct. They must first and foremost guarantee the safety of their participants. Whenever possible, they must ensure that participants have been fully informed before consenting to be part of a study. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2693556">The ASA (American Sociological Association) maintains ethical guidelines that sociologists must take into account as they conduct research. The guidelines address conducting studies, properly using existing sources, accepting funding, and publishing results.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1684289">Sociologists must try to maintain value neutrality. They must gather and analyze data objectively, setting aside their personal preferences, beliefs, and opinions. They must report findings accurately, even if they contradict personal convictions.</p>
