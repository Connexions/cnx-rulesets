      <title>Astronomy and the Days of the Week</title>
      <para id="fs-id1168047457949">The week seems independent of celestial motions, although its length may have been based on the time between quarter phases of the Moon. In Western culture, the seven days of the week are named after the seven &#8220;wanderers&#8221; that the ancients saw in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets visible to the unaided eye (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn).</para>
      <para id="fs-id1168047971185">In English, we can easily recognize the names Sun-day (Sunday), Moon-day (Monday), and Saturn-day (Saturday), but the other days are named after the Norse equivalents of the Roman gods that gave their names to the planets. In languages more directly related to Latin, the correspondences are clearer. Wednesday, Mercury&#8217;s day, for example, is <emphasis effect="italics">mercoledi</emphasis> in Italian, <emphasis effect="italics">mercredi</emphasis> in French, and <emphasis effect="italics">mi&#233;rcoles</emphasis> in Spanish. Mars gives its name to Tuesday (<emphasis effect="italics">martes</emphasis> in Spanish), Jupiter or Jove to Thursday (<emphasis effect="italics">giovedi</emphasis> in Italian), and Venus to Friday (<emphasis effect="italics">vendredi</emphasis> in French).</para>
      <para id="fs-id1168047236346">There is no reason that the week has to have seven days rather than five or eight. It is interesting to speculate that if we had lived in a planetary system where more planets were visible without a telescope, the Beatles could have been right and we might well have had &#8220;Eight Days a Week.&#8221;</para>
