    <title>Whats Your Angle?</title>
    <para>Astronomers measure how far apart objects appear in the sky by using angles. By definition, there are 360 in a circle, so a circle stretching completely around the celestial sphere contains 360. The half-sphere or dome of the sky then contains 180 from horizon to opposite horizon. Thus, if two stars are 18 apart, their separation spans about 1/10 of the dome of the sky. To give you a sense of how big a degree is, the full Moon is about half a degree across. This is about the width of your smallest finger (pinkie) seen at arms length.</para>
