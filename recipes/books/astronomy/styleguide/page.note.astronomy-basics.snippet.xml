      <title>What&#8217;s Your Angle?</title>
      <para id="fs-id1170324984134">Astronomers measure how far apart objects appear in the sky by using angles. By definition, there are 360&#176; in a circle, so a circle stretching completely around the celestial sphere contains 360&#176;. The half-sphere or dome of the sky then contains 180&#176; from horizon to opposite horizon. Thus, if two stars are 18&#176; apart, their separation spans about 1/10 of the dome of the sky. To give you a sense of how big a degree is, the full Moon is about half a degree across. This is about the width of your smallest finger (pinkie) seen at arm&#8217;s length.</para>
