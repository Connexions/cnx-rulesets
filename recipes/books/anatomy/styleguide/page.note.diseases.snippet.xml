    <para><title>Cell: Cystic Fibrosis</title>
    Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States, with about 1,000 new cases reported each year. The genetic disease is most well known for its damage to the lungs, causing breathing difficulties and chronic lung infections, but it also affects the liver, pancreas, and intestines. Only about 50 years ago, the prognosis for children born with CF was very grima life expectancy rarely over 10 years. Today, with advances in medical treatment, many CF patients live into their 30s.</para>
    <para>The symptoms of CF result from a malfunctioning membrane ion channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. In healthy people, the CFTR protein is an integral membrane protein that transports Cl ions out of the cell. In a person who has CF, the gene for the CFTR is mutated, thus, the cell manufactures a defective channel protein that typically is not incorporated into the membrane, but is instead degraded by the cell.</para>
    <para>The CFTR requires ATP in order to function, making its Cl transport a form of active transport. This characteristic puzzled researchers for a long time because the Cl ions are actually flowing <emphasis effect="italics">down</emphasis> their concentration gradient when transported out of cells. Active transport generally pumps ions <emphasis effect="italics">against</emphasis> their concentration gradient, but the CFTR presents an exception to this rule.</para>
    <para>In normal lung tissue, the movement of Cl out of the cell maintains a Cl -rich, negatively charged environment immediately outside of the cell. This is particularly important in the epithelial lining of the respiratory system. Respiratory epithelial cells secrete mucus, which serves to trap dust, bacteria, and other debris. A cilium (plural = cilia) is one of the hair-like appendages found on certain cells. Cilia on the epithelial cells move the mucus and its trapped particles up the airways away from the lungs and toward the outside. In order to be effectively moved upward, the mucus cannot be too viscous; rather it must have a thin, watery consistency. The transport of Cl and the maintenance of an electronegative environment outside of the cell attract positive ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular space. The accumulation of both Cl and Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the extracellular space creates solute-rich mucus, which has a low concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water moves from cells and extracellular matrix into the mucus, thinning it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory system, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down to be propelled out of the respiratory system.</para>
    <para>If the CFTR channel is absent, Cl ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing them from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water concentration gradient. Thus, there is no osmotic pressure pulling water into the mucus. The resulting mucus is thick and sticky, and the ciliated epithelia cannot effectively remove it from the respiratory system. Passageways in the lungs become blocked with mucus, along with the debris it carries. Bacterial infections occur more easily because bacterial cells are not effectively carried away from the lungs.</para>
