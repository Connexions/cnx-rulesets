    <para>Anti-Federalists objected to the power the Constitution gave the federal government and the absence of a bill of rights to protect individual liberties. The Federalists countered that a strong government was necessary to lead the new nation and promised to add a bill of rights to the Constitution. <emphasis effect="italics">The Federalist Papers</emphasis>, in particular, argued in favor of ratification and sought to convince people that the new government would not become tyrannical.

The large and prosperous states of Virginia and New York followed shortly thereafter, and the remaining states joined as well.</para>
