      <emphasis>Can there be functions in which the domain and range do not intersect at all?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis effect="italics">Yes. For example, the function has the set of all positive real numbers as its domain but the set of all negative real numbers as its range. As a more extreme example, a functions inputs and outputs can be completely different categories (for example, names of weekdays as inputs and numbers as outputs, as on an attendance chart), in such cases the domain and range have no elements in common.</emphasis>
