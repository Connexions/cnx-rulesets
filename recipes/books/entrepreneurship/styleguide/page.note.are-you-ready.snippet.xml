    <p id="auto_2d9dac56-8a42-4fd2-96db-a5bfe3a8ffc2_eip-id1171823792685">When money is borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, the loan is considered a personal or consumer loan. Typically, payments on these types of loans begin shortly after the funds are borrowed. Student loans are a special type of consumer borrowing that has a different structure for repayment of the debt. If you are not familiar with the special repayment arrangement for student loans, do a brief internet search to find out when student loan payments are expected to begin. </p>
    <p id="auto_2d9dac56-8a42-4fd2-96db-a5bfe3a8ffc2_eip-426">Now, assume a college student has two loans&#x2014;one for a car and one for a student loan. Assume the person gets the flu, misses a week of work at their campus job, and does not get paid for the absence. Which loan would the person be most concerned about paying? Why?</p>
