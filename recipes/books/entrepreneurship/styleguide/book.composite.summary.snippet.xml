    <p id="auto_098813de-8330-4f16-b6e0-db7740a2cdf4_eip-id1164998034443">In this section we looked at the importance of the entrepreneurial mindset. This way of thinking can energize and motivate the entrepreneur to take their business to the next level. It is a learned behavior that can be adopted by any business founder who wants to continually improve their business. In the same way, entrepreneurial spirit is a key part of the start-up business. This is a forward thinking, problem solving, can-do approach to running the business. These two aspects of the business are reinforced by the entrepreneur&#x2019;s passion. This internal drive will keep the individual going when things get tough, because their passion will carry them on to the next thing. Passion sustains the entrepreneur because it speaks to the core of what they do and why they do it.</p>
