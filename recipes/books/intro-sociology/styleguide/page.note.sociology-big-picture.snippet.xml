    <div data-type="title">The Evolution of American Hipster Subculture</div>
    <p>Skinny jeans, chunky glasses, and T-shirts with vintage logos&#x2014;the American hipster is a recognizable figure in the modern United States. Based predominately in metropolitan areas, sometimes clustered around hotspots such as the Williamsburg neighborhood in New York City, hipsters define themselves through a rejection of the mainstream. As a subculture, hipsters spurn many of the values and beliefs of U.S. culture and prefer vintage clothing to fashion and a bohemian lifestyle to one of wealth and power. While hipster culture may seem to be the new trend among young, middle-class youth, the history of the group stretches back to the early decades of the 1900s.</p>
    <p>Where did the hipster culture begin? In the early 1940s, jazz music was on the rise in the United States. Musicians were known as &#x201C;hepcats&#x201D; and had a smooth, relaxed quality that went against upright, mainstream life. Those who were &#x201C;hep&#x201D; or &#x201C;hip&#x201D; lived by the code of jazz, while those who were &#x201C;square&#x201D; lived according to society&#x2019;s rules. The idea of a &#x201C;hipster&#x201D; was born.</p>
