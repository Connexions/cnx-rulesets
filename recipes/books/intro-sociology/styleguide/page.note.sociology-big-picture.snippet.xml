    <title>Gap Year: How Different Societies Socialize Young Adults</title>
    <para>Have you ever heard of gap year? It&#x2019;s a common custom in British society. When teens finish their secondary schooling (aka high school in the United States), they often take a year &#x201C;off&#x201D; before entering college. Frequently, they might take a job, travel, or find other ways to experience another culture. Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, spent his gap year practicing survival skills in Belize, teaching English in Chile, and working on a dairy farm in the United Kingdom (Prince of Wales 2012a). His brother, Prince Harry, advocated for AIDS orphans in Africa and worked as a jackeroo (a novice ranch hand) in Australia (Prince of Wales 2012b).</para>
    <para>In the United States, this life transition point is socialized quite differently, and taking a year off is generally frowned upon. Instead, U.S. youth are encouraged to pick career paths by their mid-teens, to select a college and a major by their late teens, and to have completed all collegiate schooling or technical training for their career by their early twenties.</para>
    <para>In yet other nations, this phase of the life course is tied into conscription, a term that describes compulsory military service. Egypt, Switzerland, Turkey, and Singapore all have this system in place. Youth in these nations (often only the males) are expected to undergo a number of months or years of military training and service.</para>
    <para>How might your life be different if you lived in one of these other countries? Can you think of similar social norms&#x2014;related to life age-transition points&#x2014;that vary from country to country?</para>
