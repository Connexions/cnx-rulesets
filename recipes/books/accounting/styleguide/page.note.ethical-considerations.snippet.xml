    <p id="auto_9ca4a588-153a-4e77-a026-dcd1e62a80c4_eip-id1171820379500">When money is borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, the loan is considered a personal or consumer loan. Typically, payments on these types of loans begin shortly after the funds are borrowed. Student loans are a special type of consumer borrowing that has a different structure for repayment of the debt. If you are not familiar with the special repayment arrangement for student loans, do a brief internet search to find out when student loan payments are expected to begin. KC notes that this feature box has a learning objective tag.</p>
