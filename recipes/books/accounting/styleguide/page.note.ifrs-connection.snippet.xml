A primary benefit of a corporate legal structure is the owners of the organization do not have personal liability. That is, a corporation is &#x201C;stand alone,&#x201D; conducting business as an entity separate from its owners. Under the corporate structure, owners delegate to others (called agents) the responsibility to make day-to-day decisions regarding the operations of the business. </p>
