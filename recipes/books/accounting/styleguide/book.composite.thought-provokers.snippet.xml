        <p id="auto_4697b4ce-7e98-4de1-acfd-bb21b1041351_eip-id1171825002503">By its very nature, overhead is impossible or impractical to trace to specific jobs. In the cases where it is possible to track the costs, the additional work involved in doing so is not worth the benefit from the calculations. For example, it is impossible to determine the electricity cost for manufacturing one particular unit since electricity is being used elsewhere in the manufacturing organization. Likewise, it is not practical to keep track of how many sheets of paper were used for a specific job. Instead, overhead is accumulated in the manufacturing overhead account and applied to each specific job on the basis of the activity considered the cost driver.</p>
