      <item>A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one output for each input.</item>
      <item>If no domain is stated for a function the domain is considered to be the set of all real numbers for which the function is defined.</item>
      <item>When sketching the graph of a function each vertical line may intersect the graph, at most, once.</item>
      <item>A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, one y-intercept.</item>
      <item>To define the composition the range of f must be contained in the domain of g.</item>
      <item>Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin.</item>
