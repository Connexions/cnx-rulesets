    <title>Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle</title>
    <para id="fs-id1170571610304">Some of the geometric formulas we take for granted today were first derived by methods that anticipate some of the methods of calculus.</para>
    <para id="fs-id1170571610320">We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. To see this, carry out the following steps:</para>
    <list id="fs-id1170571610331" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
      <item>Express the height h and the base b of the isosceles triangle in <link target-id="CNX_Calc_Figure_02_03_009"/> in terms of equation.<newline/></item>
      <item>Using the expressions that you obtained in step 1, express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms of  and r.</item>
      <item>If an n-sided regular polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius r, find a relationship between  and n. </item>
      <item>Find an expression for the area of the n-sided polygon in terms of r and t.</item>
      <item>To find a formula for the area of the circle, find the limit of the expression in step 4 as t goes to zero.</item>
    </list>
