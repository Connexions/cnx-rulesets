    <title>Summary</title>
    <para>Genes are sequences of DNA that code for a particular trait. Different versions of a gene are called alleles sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the dominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the recessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene is expressed, and what the outcome will be in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics is a function of the interaction between our genes and our environments.</para>
