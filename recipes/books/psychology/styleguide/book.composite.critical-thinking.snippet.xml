      <problem>
        <para>The theory of evolution by natural selection requires variability of a given trait. Why is variability necessary and where does it come from?</para>
      </problem>
      <solution>
        <para>Variability is essential for natural selection to work. If all individuals are the same on a given trait, there will be no relative difference in their reproductive success because everyone will be equally adapted to their environments on that trait. Mutations are one source of variability, but sexual reproduction is another important source of variation given that individuals inherit half of their genetic makeup from each of their parents.</para>
