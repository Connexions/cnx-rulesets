    <title>Resolution</title>
    <para>From the results of the Gram stain, the technician now knows that Cindys infection is caused by spherical, gram-positive bacteria that form grape-like clusters, which is typical of staphylococcal bacteria. After some additional testing, the technician determines that these bacteria are the medically important species known as <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis></term>, a common culprit in wound infections. Because some strains of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> are resistant to many antibiotics, skin infections may spread to other areas of the body and become serious, sometimes even resulting in amputations or death if the correct antibiotics are not used.</para>
    <para>After testing several antibiotics, the lab is able to identify one that is effective against this particular strain of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>. Cindys doctor quickly prescribes the medication and emphasizes the importance of taking the entire course of antibiotics, even if the infection appears to clear up before the last scheduled dose. This reduces the risk that any especially resistant bacteria could survive, causing a second infection or spreading to another person.</para>
