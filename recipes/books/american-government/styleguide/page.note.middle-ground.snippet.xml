    <title>Term Limits</title>
    <para>One of the objections raised to the Constitution&#x2019;s new government was that it did not set term limits for members of Congress or the president. Those who opposed a strong central government argued that this failure could allow a handful of powerful men to gain control of the nation and rule it for as long as they wished. Although the framers did not anticipate the idea of career politicians, those who supported the Constitution argued that reelecting the president and reappointing senators by state legislatures would create a body of experienced men who could better guide the country through crises. A president who did not prove to be a good leader would be voted out of office instead of being reelected. In fact, presidents long followed George Washington&#x2019;s example and limited themselves to two terms. Only in 1951, after Franklin <term class="no-emphasis">Roosevelt</term> had been elected four times, was the Twenty-Second Amendment passed to restrict the presidency to two terms.</para>

      <emphasis effect="italics">Are term limits a good idea? Should they have originally been included in the Constitution? Why or why not? Are there times when term limits might not be good?</emphasis>
