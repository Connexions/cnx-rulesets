  <para id="eip-id1164368045807">Lauri Goodman Lampson is President and CEO of Planning Design Research Corporation <cite target-id="rf-1"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-1">Reference data here.</note></cite>,  a firm that analyzes work environments to understand how employees work and what kind of spaces and facilities they need to do their best, most productive work. Lampson was hired by Accenture to evaluate and improve their location in Houston. Accenture&#x2019;s Houston office was a 3-story, 66,000 square foot building that served 800 employees <cite target-id="rf-2"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-2">Reference data here.</note></cite>.  Accenture employees are consultants themselves; they typically spend up to two-thirds of their working time away from the office serving clients. Lampson worked with Accenture Director of Workplaces Dan Johnson, and Steelcase, an office furniture manufacturer, to study how the Houston space was used. Lampson&#x2019;s "focus is on gaining a deep understanding of the business and its strategy for success and then developing strategic workplace solutions that enable those goals".<cite target-id="rf-3"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-3">Reference data here.</note></cite>  To achieve this, Lampson and Steelcase performed an analysis of employee demographics and expectations, as well as studies of how employees actually interacted with each other and performed tasks in the workplace. Accenture wanted to have a workspace that fostered their strengths: worker innovation, collaboration, and flexibility<cite target-id="rf-4"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-4">Reference data here.</note></cite>.  Understanding a firm&#x2019;s strengths is an important step in strategic analysis, and Lampson&#x2019;s focus on supporting those strengths in the workplace environment led to Workplace 2.0, Accenture&#x2019;s reimagined facility. Not only does the new workspace provide better physical and technological support for collaboration among Accenture employees, but Lampson and Steelcase were able to identify opportunities for Accenture to significantly reduce the size of their offices. Accenture saves money by using less space (they were able to downsize to a single floor of 25,000 square feet to serve the same number of workers) and supports worker interaction and engagement by providing a more effective workspace.
