    <title>Sustainability and Responsible Management: Can LEGO Give up Plastic?</title>
    <para id="eip-id1164414571220">
      <quote id="eip-id1164414436906">"In 2012, the LEGO Group first shared its ambition to find and implement sustainable alternatives to the current raw materials used to manufacture LEGO products by 2030. The ambition is part of the LEGO Group&#x2019;s work to
        reduce its environmental footprint and leave a positive impact on the planet our children will inherit."</quote>

    <para id="eip-265">Danish toy company LEGO announced in 2015 that it would invest almost $160 million dollars into its efforts to meet the goal announced in 2012. You know LEGO&#x2014;they are the colored plastic bricks that snap together to make toys
      ranging from Harry Potter castles to Star Wars fighter craft. The family-owned company was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, and has since grown to be the world&#x2019;s number one toy brand.</para>
    <para id="eip-641">Given that LEGO and plastic seem to go hand in hand, why would the company want to give up on the material that makes their toys so successful? LEGO&#x2019;s manufacturing process relies on plastic to make highly precise plastic bricks
      that always fit together securely and easily. Replacing the plastic with another material that is durable, can be brightly colored, and can be molded as precisely is a difficult task. LEGO&#x2019;s leadership has decided that a strategic position based on
      fossil fuels is not sustainable and is making plans now to transition to a more environmentally friendly material to manufacture its products.</para>
    <para id="eip-728">Switching from oil-based ABS plastic might make economic sense as well. Manufacturers who reply on petroleum-based products must weather volatile oil prices. LEGO&#x2019;s raw materials costs could skyrocket overnight if the price of oil
      climbs again like it did in 2011. That price spike was due to conflict in Libya and other parts of the Arab world, something entirely beyond the control of any business.</para>
    <para id="eip-924">Technological innovations in bio-based plastics may be the answer for LEGO, which is working with university researchers around the globe to find a solution to their carbon-footprint problem.</para>
