    <para id="eip-564">The external environment of a firm is composed of two primary layers: the Macro environment, which includes facts and situations that a firm must be aware of, but cannot always influence. The macro environment includes political
      and legal aspects, economic indicators, sociocultural trends, demographic facts, technological changes, and environmental aspects. The macro environment is analyzed using PESTEL.</para>
    <para id="eip-654">The second layer is a firm&#x2019;s micro environment, which includes the components of a firm&#x2019;s industry. This includes competitors, suppliers, and customers. Porter&#x2019;s Five Forces of industry competition capture the dynamic relationships
      between these components.</para>
