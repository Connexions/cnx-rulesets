    <p id="auto_cc72a344-4dcc-47cf-8c3d-c3bc8655bfa8_59453">What does it take to manufacture the sign outside the stadium? It starts with the production department requisitioning vinyl and ink from the raw materials inventory.  Once the raw materials are delivered to the production department, the product is considered work-in-process inventory. There, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term">direct labor</span> is used to place the material into the printer, align the computerized design, and have it printed on the vinyl.  The direct materials and direct labor are known and recorded on the job order cost sheet. When the Production Department has completed its work, the sign and the job order cost sheet are transferred to the Finishing Department.  This department requests wood for framing and grommets for attaching the sign from raw materials inventory.  This department adds direct labor, wood, and grommets to the already printed sign to finish it properly.  </p>
