# Where can I find information on creating an issue/PR/commit?

https://github.com/openstax/cnx-recipes/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

# What is your release management workflow like?

- The team sprints at a two week cadence. Once items move from the backlog to In Progress, they must have story points attached. 
- When coding is complete on a card, the card moves to Code Review with an attached PR(s) and assigned reviewers. 
- When code has been reviewed, it moves to QA testing where Alan tests on QA and staging (after Britt requests code to staging from DevOps). 
- On code release (production) day, Britt requests code deploys to production and content servers. Alan verifies that the code is on Production. 

# How does the team work with a crit-sit? 

- When a crit-sit occurs, Alina creates a crit-sit in Slack and notifies the entire Books team. 
- Britt takes this information to the CNX team as it is possible that there could be overlap. 
- The Books team works together to identify the root of the crit-sit. 
- From there, Books Developers work together to resolve the crit-sit. 
- When the crit-sit is resolved, Alina will announce this to the org. The team will hold a retrospective on the crit-sit as soon as possible.  

# What are the TBDs doing to prevent crit-sits from occurring more often? 
- Identify "snowflake" cases in code, infrastructure, or elsewhere to find ways to standardize to prevent points of failure in one off cases. 
- The team will work to cross-polinate information with other teams when their is an active crit-sit. 
- Polish recipe will be merged into the cn-recipe repo (with drop down added, some kind of oer.exports as-is template will be added to support the dropdown) - this is to prevent a "snowflake" case. 
- Figure out ways to to communicate between teams when code changes might affect them, beyond the regular cross-polination of info.
