</p></section></section><section data-depth="1" id="eip-218"><h1 data-type="title">About <em data-effect="italics">U.S. History</em></h1><p id="eip-804">
<em data-effect="italics">U.S. History</em> has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most introductory U.S. History courses. At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning. Instructors can also customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.
</p><section data-depth="2" id="eip-177"><h2 data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</h2><p id="eip-501">
To develop <em data-effect="italics">U.S. History</em>, we solicited ideas from historians at all levels of higher education, from community colleges to Ph.D.-granting universities. They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet their and their students&#8217; needs. 
</p>
<p id="eip-id1172550690317">The result is a book that covers the breadth of the chronological history of the United States and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. <em data-effect="italics">U.S. History</em> explores the key forces and major developments that together form the American experience, with particular attention paid to considering issues of race, class, and gender.</p>

<p id="eip-id1172550637275">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary. Reviewer feedback centered around achieving equilibrium between the various political, social, and cultural dynamics that permeate history. The outcome is a balanced approach to U.S. history, considering the people, events, and ideas that have shaped the United States from both the top down (politics, economics, diplomacy) and bottom up (eyewitness accounts, lived experience).</p>

<p id="eip-id1172550180945">While the book is organized primarily chronologically, as needed, material treating different topics or regions over the same time period is spread over multiple chapters. For example, chapters 9, 11, and 12 look at economic, political, social, and cultural developments during the first half of the eighteenth century in the North, West, and South respectively, while chapters 18 to 20 closely examine industrialization, urbanization, and politics in the period after Reconstruction.</p>

</figure><p id="eip-546">Globalization, the ever-increasing interconnectedness of the world, is not a new phenomenon, but it accelerated when western Europeans discovered the riches of the East. During the Crusades (1095&#8211;1291), Europeans developed an appetite for spices, silk, porcelain, sugar, and other luxury items from the East, for which they traded fur, timber, and Slavic people they captured and sold (hence the word <em data-effect="italics">slave</em>). But when the Silk Road, the long overland trading route from China to the Mediterranean, became costlier and more dangerous to travel, Europeans searched for a more efficient and inexpensive trade route over water, initiating the development of what we now call the Atlantic World.</p><p id="eip-506">In pursuit of commerce in Asia, fifteenth-century traders unexpectedly encountered a &#8220;New World&#8221; populated by millions and home to sophisticated and numerous peoples. Mistakenly believing they had reached the East Indies, these early explorers called its inhabitants Indians. West Africa, a diverse and culturally rich area, soon entered the stage as other nations exploited its slave trade and brought its peoples to the New World in chains. Although Europeans would come to dominate the New World, they could not have done so without Africans and native peoples (<a href="#CNX_History_01_00_ThreeWomen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idm14751392">Between nine and fifteen thousand years ago, some scholars believe that a land bridge existed between Asia and North America that we now call <span data-type="term">Beringia</span>. The first inhabitants of what would be named the Americas migrated across this bridge in search of food. When the glaciers melted, water engulfed Beringia, and the Bering Strait was formed. Later settlers came by boat across the narrow strait. (The fact that Asians and American Indians share genetic markers on a Y chromosome lends credibility to this migration theory.) Continually moving southward, the settlers eventually populated both North and South America, creating unique cultures that ranged from the highly complex and urban Aztec civilization in what is now Mexico City to the woodland tribes of eastern North America. Recent research along the west coast of South America suggests that migrant populations may have traveled down this coast by water as well as by land.</p>
<p id="fs-idm13889168">Researchers believe that about ten thousand years ago, humans also began the domestication of plants and animals, adding agriculture as a means of sustenance to hunting and gathering techniques. With this agricultural revolution, and the more abundant and reliable food supplies it brought, populations grew and people were able to develop a more settled way of life, building permanent settlements. Nowhere in the Americas was this more obvious than in Mesoamerica (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Americas" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Americas"><figcaption>This map shows the extent of the major civilizations of the Western Hemisphere.

</figure><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm48030480"><h1 data-type="title">THE FIRST AMERICANS: THE OLMEC</h1><p id="fs-idm31997616">Mesoamerica is the geographic area stretching from north of Panama up to the desert of central Mexico. Although marked by great topographic, linguistic, and cultural diversity, this region cradled a number of civilizations with similar characteristics. Mesoamericans were <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">polytheistic</span>; their gods possessed both male and female traits and demanded blood sacrifices of enemies taken in battle or ritual bloodletting. Corn, or maize, domesticated by 5000 BCE, formed the basis of their diet. They developed a mathematical system, built huge edifices, and devised a calendar that accurately predicted eclipses and solstices and that priest-astronomers used to direct the planting and harvesting of crops. Most important for our knowledge of these peoples, they created the only known written language in the Western Hemisphere; researchers have made much progress in interpreting the inscriptions on their temples and pyramids. Though the area had no overarching political structure, trade over long distances helped diffuse culture. Weapons made of obsidian, jewelry crafted from jade, feathers woven into clothing and ornaments, and cacao beans that were whipped into a chocolate drink formed the basis of commerce. The mother of Mesoamerican cultures was the Olmec civilization.</p>
<p id="fs-idm18507776">Flourishing along the hot Gulf Coast of Mexico from about 1200 to about 400 BCE, the Olmec produced a number of major works of art, architecture, pottery, and sculpture. Most recognizable are their giant head sculptures (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Olmec" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) and the pyramid in La Venta. The Olmec built aqueducts to transport water into their cities and irrigate their fields. They grew maize, squash, beans, and tomatoes. They also bred small domesticated dogs which, along with fish, provided their protein. Although no one knows what happened to the Olmec after about 400 BCE, in part because the jungle reclaimed many of their cities, their culture was the base upon which the Maya and the Aztec built. It was the Olmec who worshipped a rain god, a maize god, and the feathered serpent so important in the future pantheons of the Aztecs (who called him Quetzalcoatl) and the Maya (to whom he was Kukulkan). The Olmec also developed a system of trade throughout Mesoamerica, giving rise to an elite class.</p>

<p id="fs-idp71404736">After the decline of the Olmec, a city rose in the fertile central highlands of Mesoamerica. One of the largest population centers in pre-Columbian America and home to more than 100,000 people at its height in about 500 CE, Teotihuacan was located about thirty miles northeast of modern Mexico City. The ethnicity of this settlement&#8217;s inhabitants is debated; some scholars believe it was a multiethnic city. Large-scale agriculture and the resultant abundance of food allowed time for people to develop special trades and skills other than farming. Builders constructed over twenty-two hundred apartment compounds for multiple families, as well as more than a hundred temples. Among these were the Pyramid of the Sun (which is two hundred feet high) and the Pyramid of the Moon (one hundred and fifty feet high). Near the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, graves have been uncovered that suggest humans were sacrificed for religious purposes. The city was also the center for trade, which extended to settlements on Mesoamerica&#8217;s Gulf Coast.</p>
<p id="fs-idp120907584">The Maya were one Mesoamerican culture that had strong ties to Teotihuacan. The Maya&#8217;s architectural and mathematical contributions were significant. Flourishing from roughly 2000 BCE to 900 CE in what is now Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and Guatemala, the Maya perfected the calendar and written language the Olmec had begun. They devised a written mathematical system to record crop yields and the size of the population, and to assist in trade. Surrounded by farms relying on primitive agriculture, they built the city-states of Copan, Tikal, and Chichen Itza along their major trade routes, as well as temples, statues of gods, pyramids, and astronomical observatories (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Chichen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). However, because of poor soil and a drought that lasted nearly two centuries, their civilization declined by about 900 CE and they abandoned their large population centers.</p>

<p id="fs-idp97753424">The Spanish found little organized resistance among the weakened Maya upon their arrival in the 1520s. However, they did find Mayan history, in the form of glyphs, or pictures representing words, recorded in folding books called codices (the singular is <em data-effect="italics">codex</em>). In 1562, Bishop Diego de Landa, who feared the converted natives had reverted to their traditional religious practices, collected and burned every codex he could find. Today only a few survive.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm73887824"><h1 data-type="title">THE AZTEC</h1>
<p id="fs-idm47108288">When the Spaniard Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s arrived on the coast of Mexico in the sixteenth century, at the site of present-day Veracruz, he soon heard of a great city ruled by an emperor named Moctezuma. This city was tremendously wealthy&#8212;filled with gold&#8212;and took in tribute from surrounding tribes. The riches and complexity Cort&#233;s found when he arrived at that city, known as Tenochtitl&#225;n, were far beyond anything he or his men had ever seen.</p>
<p id="fs-idp32058224">According to legend, a warlike people called the Aztec (also known as the Mexica) had left a city called Aztl&#225;n and traveled south to the site of present-day Mexico City. In 1325, they began construction of Tenochtitl&#225;n on an island in Lake Texcoco. By 1519, when Cort&#233;s arrived, this settlement contained upwards of 200,000 inhabitants and was certainly the largest city in the Western Hemisphere at that time and probably larger than any European city (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Tenochtitl" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). One of Cort&#233;s&#8217;s soldiers, Bernal D&#237;az del Castillo, recorded his impressions upon first seeing it: &#8220;When we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said it was like the enchantments . . . on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? . . . I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about.&#8221;</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Tenochtitl"><figcaption>This rendering of the Aztec island city of Tenochtitl&#225;n depicts the causeways that connected the central city to the surrounding land. Envoys from surrounding tribes brought tribute to the Emperor.</figcaption>

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm70484976">Unlike the dirty, fetid cities of Europe at the time, Tenochtitl&#225;n was well planned, clean, and orderly. The city had neighborhoods for specific occupations, a trash collection system, markets, two aqueducts bringing in fresh water, and public buildings and temples. Unlike the Spanish, Aztecs bathed daily, and wealthy homes might even contain a steam bath. A labor force of slaves from subjugated neighboring tribes had built the fabulous city and the three causeways that connected it to the mainland. To farm, the Aztec constructed barges made of reeds and filled them with fertile soil. Lake water constantly irrigated these <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">chinampas</em></span>, or &#8220;floating gardens,&#8221; which are still in use and can be seen today in Xochimilco, a district of Mexico City.</p>

<p id="fs-idp18992656">Each god in the Aztec pantheon represented and ruled an aspect of the natural world, such as the heavens, farming, rain, fertility, sacrifice, and combat. A ruling class of warrior nobles and priests performed ritual human sacrifice daily to sustain the sun on its long journey across the sky, to appease or feed the gods, and to stimulate agricultural production. The sacrificial ceremony included cutting open the chest of a criminal or captured warrior with an obsidian knife and removing the still-beating heart (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Aztec" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>


<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Aztec"><figcaption>In this illustration, an Aztec priest cuts out the beating heart of a sacrificial victim before throwing the body down from the temple.

<p id="fs-idm65242592">The following is an excerpt from the sixteenth-century Florentine Codex of the writings of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, a priest and early chronicler of Aztec history. When an old man from Xochimilco first saw the Spanish in Veracruz, he recounted an earlier dream to Moctezuma, the ruler of the Aztecs.</p>
<p id="fs-idm56772304">
<blockquote id="fs-idm44401712">Said Quzatli to the sovereign, &#8220;Oh mighty lord, if because I tell you the truth I am to die, nevertheless I am here in your presence and you may do what you wish to me!&#8221; He narrated that mounted men would come to this land in a great wooden house [ships] this structure was to lodge many men, serving them as a home; within they would eat and sleep. On the surface of this house they would cook their food, walk and play as if they were on firm land. They were to be white, bearded men, dressed in different colors and on their heads they would wear round coverings.</blockquote>
</p>
<p id="fs-idm21191008">Ten years before the arrival of the Spanish, Moctezuma received several omens which at the time he could not interpret. A fiery object appeared in the night sky, a spontaneous fire broke out in a religious temple and could not be extinguished with water, a water spout appeared in Lake Texcoco, and a woman could be heard wailing, &#8220;O my children we are about to go forever.&#8221; Moctezuma also had dreams and premonitions of impending disaster. These foretellings were recorded after the Aztecs&#8217; destruction. They do, however, give us insight into the importance placed upon signs and omens in the pre-Columbian world.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp10679264"><h1 data-type="title">THE INCA</h1>
<p id="fs-idp3702384">In South America, the most highly developed and complex society was that of the Inca, whose name means &#8220;lord&#8221; or &#8220;ruler&#8221; in the Andean language called Quechua. At its height in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Inca Empire, located on the Pacific coast and straddling the Andes Mountains, extended some twenty-five hundred miles. It stretched from modern-day Colombia in the north to Chile in the south and included cities built at an altitude of 14,000 feet above sea level. Its road system, kept free of debris and repaired by workers stationed at varying intervals, rivaled that of the Romans and efficiently connected the sprawling empire. The Inca, like all other pre-Columbian societies, did not use axle-mounted wheels for transportation. They built stepped roads to ascend and descend the steep slopes of the Andes; these would have been impractical for wheeled vehicles but worked well for pedestrians. These roads enabled the rapid movement of the highly trained Incan army. Also like the Romans, the Inca were effective administrators. Runners called <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">chasquis</em></span> traversed the roads in a continuous relay system, ensuring quick communication over long distances. The Inca had no system of writing, however. They communicated and kept records using a system of colored strings and knots called the <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">quipu</em></span> (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Quipu" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Quipu"><figcaption>The Inca had no written language. Instead, they communicated and kept records by means of a system of knots and colored strings called the <em data-effect="italics">quipu</em>. Each of these knots and strings possessed a distinct meaning intelligible to those educated in their significance.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp1370528" data-alt="An Inca quipu is shown, a string with a number of thinner, knotted strings dangling from it.">

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idp4842736">The Inca people worshipped their lord who, as a member of an elite ruling class, had absolute authority over every aspect of life. Much like feudal lords in Europe at the time, the ruling class lived off the labor of the peasants, collecting vast wealth that accompanied them as they went, mummified, into the next life. The Inca farmed corn, beans, squash, quinoa (a grain cultivated for its seeds), and the indigenous potato on terraced land they hacked from the steep mountains. Peasants received only one-third of their crops for themselves. The Inca ruler required a third, and a third was set aside in a kind of welfare system for those unable to work. Huge storehouses were filled with food for times of need. Each peasant also worked for the Inca ruler a number of days per month on public works projects, a requirement known as the <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">mita</em></span>. For example, peasants constructed rope bridges made of grass to span the mountains above fast-flowing icy rivers. In return, the lord provided laws, protection, and relief in times of famine.</p>
<p id="fs-idm49393184">The Inca worshipped the sun god Inti and called gold the &#8220;sweat&#8221; of the sun. Unlike the Maya and the Aztecs, they rarely practiced human sacrifice and usually offered the gods food, clothing, and coca leaves. In times of dire emergency, however, such as in the aftermath of earthquakes, volcanoes, or crop failure, they resorted to sacrificing prisoners. The ultimate sacrifice was children, who were specially selected and well fed. The Inca believed these children would immediately go to a much better afterlife.</p>
<p id="fs-idm86831360">In 1911, the American historian Hiram Bingham uncovered the lost Incan city of Machu Picchu (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Machu" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Located about fifty miles northwest of Cusco, Peru, at an altitude of about 8,000 feet, the city had been built in 1450 and inexplicably abandoned roughly a hundred years later. Scholars believe the city was used for religious ceremonial purposes and housed the priesthood. The architectural beauty of this city is unrivaled. Using only the strength of human labor and no machines, the Inca constructed walls and buildings of polished stones, some weighing over fifty tons, that were fitted together perfectly without the use of mortar. In 1983, UNESCO designated the ruined city a World Heritage Site.</p>
<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Machu"><figcaption>Located in today&#8217;s Peru at an altitude of nearly 8,000 feet, Machu Picchu was a ceremonial Incan city built about 1450 CE.</figcaption>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm91929888"><h1 data-type="title">NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS</h1>
<p id="fs-idm45461312">With few exceptions, the North American native cultures were much more widely dispersed than the Mayan, Aztec, and Incan societies, and did not have their population size or organized social structures. Although the cultivation of corn had made its way north, many Indians still practiced hunting and gathering. Horses, first introduced by the Spanish, allowed the Plains Indians to more easily follow and hunt the huge herds of bison. A few societies had evolved into relatively complex forms, but they were already in decline at the time of Christopher Columbus&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p id="fs-idm106062960">In the southwestern part of today&#8217;s United States dwelled several groups we collectively call the Pueblo. The Spanish first gave them this name, which means &#8220;town&#8221; or &#8220;village,&#8221; because they lived in towns or villages of permanent stone-and-mud buildings with thatched roofs. Like present-day apartment houses, these buildings had multiple stories, each with multiple rooms. The three main groups of the Pueblo people were the Mogollon, Hohokam, and Anasazi.</p>
<p id="fs-idm48998032">The Mogollon thrived in the Mimbres Valley (New Mexico) from about 150 BCE to 1450 CE. They developed a distinctive artistic style for painting bowls with finely drawn geometric figures and wildlife, especially birds, in black on a white background. Beginning about 600 CE, the Hohokam built an extensive irrigation system of canals to irrigate the desert and grow fields of corn, beans, and squash. By 1300, their crop yields were supporting the most highly populated settlements in the southwest. The Hohokam decorated pottery with a red-on-buff design and made jewelry of turquoise. In the high desert of New Mexico, the Anasazi, whose name means &#8220;ancient enemy&#8221; or &#8220;ancient ones,&#8221; carved homes from steep cliffs accessed by ladders or ropes that could be pulled in at night or in case of enemy attack (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Anasazi" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Anasazi"><figcaption>To access their homes, the cliff-dwelling Anasazi used ropes or ladders that could be pulled in at night for safety. These pueblos may be viewed today in Canyon de Chelly National Monument (above) in Arizona and Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado.</figcaption>

</span>

</figure>
<p id="fs-idm42851472">Roads extending some 180 miles connected the Pueblos&#8217; smaller urban centers to each other and to Chaco Canyon, which by 1050 CE had become the administrative, religious, and cultural center of their civilization. A century later, however, probably because of drought, the Pueblo peoples abandoned their cities. Their present-day descendants include the Hopi and Zuni tribes.</p>
<p id="fs-idm56849856">The Indian groups who lived in the present-day Ohio River Valley and achieved their cultural apex from the first century CE to 400 CE are collectively known as the Hopewell culture. Their settlements, unlike those of the southwest, were small hamlets. They lived in wattle-and-daub houses (made from woven lattice branches &#8220;daubed&#8221; with wet mud, clay, or sand and straw) and practiced agriculture, which they supplemented by hunting and fishing. Utilizing waterways, they developed trade routes stretching from Canada to Louisiana, where they exchanged goods with other tribes and negotiated in many different languages. From the coast they received shells; from Canada, copper; and from the Rocky Mountains, obsidian. With these materials they created necklaces, woven mats, and exquisite carvings. What remains of their culture today are huge burial mounds and earthworks. Many of the mounds that were opened by archaeologists contained artworks and other goods that indicate their society was socially stratified.</p>
<p id="fs-idm14090480">Perhaps the largest indigenous cultural and population center in North America was located along the Mississippi River near present-day St. Louis. At its height in about 1100 CE, this five-square-mile city, now called Cahokia, was home to more than ten thousand residents; tens of thousands more lived on farms surrounding the urban center. The city also contained one hundred and twenty earthen mounds or pyramids, each dominating a particular neighborhood and on each of which lived a leader who exercised authority over the surrounding area. The largest mound covered fifteen acres. Cahokia was the hub of political and trading activities along the Mississippi River. After 1300 CE, however, this civilization declined&#8212;possibly because the area became unable to support the large population.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp8778560"><h1 data-type="title">INDIANS OF THE EASTERN WOODLAND</h1>
<p id="fs-idp11367472">Encouraged by the wealth found by the Spanish in the settled civilizations to the south, fifteenth- and sixteenth-century English, Dutch, and French explorers expected to discover the same in North America. What they found instead were small, disparate communities, many already ravaged by European diseases brought by the Spanish and transmitted among the natives. Rather than gold and silver, there was an abundance of land, and the timber and fur that land could produce.</p>

<p id="fs-idp12049120">The Indians living east of the Mississippi did not construct the large and complex societies of those to the west. Because they lived in small autonomous clans or tribal units, each group adapted to the specific environment in which it lived (<a href="#CNX_History_01_01_Tribes" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). These groups were by no means unified, and warfare among tribes was common as they sought to increase their hunting and fishing areas. Still, these tribes shared some common traits. A chief or group of tribal elders made decisions, and although the chief was male, usually the women selected and counseled him. Gender roles were not as fixed as they were in the patriarchal societies of Europe, Mesoamerica, and South America.</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_01_01_Tribes"><figcaption>This map indicates the locations of the three Pueblo cultures the major Eastern Woodland Indian tribes, and the tribes of the Southeast, as well as the location of the ancient city of Cahokia.</figcaption>

</span>

</figure>
<p id="fs-idm53475360">Women typically cultivated corn, beans, and squash and harvested nuts and berries, while men hunted, fished, and provided protection. But both took responsibility for raising children, and most major Indian societies in the east were matriarchal. In tribes such as the Iroquois, Lenape, Muscogee, and Cherokee, women had both power and influence. They counseled the chief and passed on the traditions of the tribe. This <span data-type="term">matriarchy</span> changed dramatically with the coming of the Europeans, who introduced, sometimes forcibly, their own customs and traditions to the natives.</p>
<p id="fs-idp43801504">Clashing beliefs about land ownership and use of the environment would be the greatest area of conflict with Europeans. Although tribes often claimed the right to certain hunting grounds&#8212;usually identified by some geographical landmark&#8212;Indians did not practice, or in general even have the concept of, private ownership of land. There were tribal hunting grounds, usually identified by some geographical landmark, but there was no private ownership of land. A person&#8217;s possessions included only what he or she had made, such as tools or weapons. The European Christian worldview, on the other hand, viewed land as the source of wealth. According to the Christian Bible, God created humanity in his own image with the command to use and subdue the rest of creation, which included not only land, but also all animal life. Upon their arrival in North America, Europeans found no fences, no signs designating ownership. Land, and the game that populated it, they believed, were there for the taking.</p>

<p id="fs-idp97087520">Great civilizations had risen and fallen in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans. In North America, the complex Pueblo societies including the Mogollon, Hohokam, and Anasazi as well as the city at Cahokia had peaked and were largely memories. The Eastern Woodland peoples were thriving, but they were soon overwhelmed as the number of English, French, and Dutch settlers increased.</p>
<p id="fs-idp93843104">Mesoamerica and South America had also witnessed the rise and fall of cultures. The once-mighty Mayan population centers were largely empty. In 1492, however, the Aztecs in Mexico City were at their peak. Subjugating surrounding tribes and requiring tribute of both humans for sacrifice and goods for consumption, the island city of Tenochtitl&#225;n was the hub of an ever-widening commercial center and the equal of any large European city until Cort&#233;s destroyed it. Further south in Peru, the Inca linked one of the largest empires in history through the use of roads and disciplined armies. Without the use of the wheel, they cut and fashioned stone to build Machu Picchu high in the Andes before abandoning the city for unknown reasons. Thus, depending on what part of the New World they explored, the Europeans encountered peoples that diverged widely in their cultures, traditions, and numbers.</p>

<p id="fs-idm1084976">The fall of the Roman Empire (476 CE) and the beginning of the European Renaissance in the late fourteenth century roughly bookend the period we call the Middle Ages. Without a dominant centralized power or overarching cultural hub, Europe experienced political and military discord during this time. Its inhabitants retreated into walled cities, fearing marauding pillagers including Vikings, Mongols, Arabs, and Magyars. In return for protection, they submitted to powerful lords and their armies of knights. In their brief, hard lives, few people traveled more than ten miles from the place they were born.</p>
<p id="fs-idm129129536">The Christian Church remained intact, however, and emerged from the period as a unified and powerful institution. Priests, tucked away in monasteries, kept knowledge alive by collecting and copying religious and secular manuscripts, often adding beautiful drawings or artwork. Social and economic devastation arrived in 1340s, however, when Genoese merchants returning from the Black Sea unwittingly brought with them a rat-borne and highly contagious disease, known as the bubonic plague. In a few short years, it had killed many millions, about one-third of Europe&#8217;s population. A different strain, spread by airborne germs, also killed many. Together these two are collectively called the <span data-type="term">Black Death</span> (<a href="#CNX_History_01_02_BlackDeath" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Entire villages disappeared. A high birth rate, however, coupled with bountiful harvests, meant that the population grew during the next century. By 1450, a newly rejuvenated European society was on the brink of tremendous change.</p><figure id="CNX_History_01_02_BlackDeath"><figcaption>This image depicts the bodily swellings, or buboes, characteristic of the Black Death.</figcaption>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm14124320"><h1 data-type="title">LIFE IN FEUDAL EUROPE</h1>
<p id="fs-idm32818064">During the Middle Ages, most Europeans lived in small villages that consisted of a manorial house or castle for the lord, a church, and simple homes for the peasants or <span data-type="term">serfs</span>, who made up about 60 percent of western Europe&#8217;s population. Hundreds of these castles and walled cities remain all over Europe (<a href="#CNX_History_01_02_Carcass" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="CNX_History_01_02_Carcass"><figcaption>One of the most beautifully preserved medieval walled cities is Carcassonne, France. Notice the use of a double wall.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm66461600" data-alt="A photograph shows the medieval walled city of Carcassonne. It is surrounded by a high double wall with slots at the top, likely for archers or other defenders to use, and it incorporates several round parapets with narrow window openings.">

It is surrounded by a high double wall with slots at the top, likely for archers or other defenders to use, and it incorporates several round parapets with narrow window openings."/>
</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm17981568">Europe&#8217;s <span data-type="term">feudal society</span> was a mutually supportive system. The lords owned the land; knights gave military service to a lord and carried out his justice; serfs worked the land in return for the protection offered by the lord&#8217;s castle or the walls of his city, into which they fled in times of danger from invaders. Much land was communally farmed at first, but as lords became more powerful they extended their ownership and rented land to their subjects. Thus, although they were technically free, serfs were effectively bound to the land they worked, which supported them and their families as well as the lord and all who depended on him. The Catholic Church, the only church in Europe at the time, also owned vast tracts of land and became very wealthy by collecting not only tithes (taxes consisting of 10 percent of annual earnings) but also rents on its lands.</p>

<p id="fs-idm20718960">A serf&#8217;s life was difficult. Women often died in childbirth, and perhaps one-third of children died before the age of five. Without sanitation or medicine, many people perished from diseases we consider inconsequential today; few lived to be older than forty-five. Entire families, usually including grandparents, lived in one- or two-room hovels that were cold, dark, and dirty. A fire was kept lit and was always a danger to the thatched roofs, while its constant smoke affected the inhabitants&#8217; health and eyesight. Most individuals owned no more than two sets of clothing, consisting of a woolen jacket or tunic and linen undergarments, and bathed only when the waters melted in spring.</p>

<p id="fs-idm100329760">In an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">agrarian society</span>, the seasons dictate the rhythm of life. Everyone in Europe&#8217;s feudal society had a job to do and worked hard. The father was the unquestioned head of the family. Idleness meant hunger. When the land began to thaw in early spring, peasants started tilling the soil with primitive wooden plows and crude rakes and hoes. Then they planted crops of wheat, rye, barley, and oats, reaping small yields that barely sustained the population. Bad weather, crop disease, or insect infestation could cause an entire village to starve or force the survivors to move to another location.</p>

<p id="fs-idm39895504">Early summer saw the first harvesting of hay, which was stored until needed to feed the animals in winter. Men and boys sheared the sheep, now heavy with wool from the cold weather, while women and children washed the wool and spun it into yarn. The coming of fall meant crops needed to be harvested and prepared for winter. Livestock was butchered and the meat smoked or salted to preserve it. With the harvest in and the provisions stored, fall was also the time for celebrating and giving thanks to God. Winter brought the people indoors to weave yarn into fabric, sew clothing, thresh grain, and keep the fires going. Everyone celebrated the birth of Christ in conjunction with the winter solstice.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm31416240"><h1 data-type="title">THE CHURCH AND SOCIETY</h1>
<p id="fs-idm81964320">After the fall of Rome, the Christian Church&#8212;united in dogma but unofficially divided into western and eastern branches&#8212;was the only organized institution in medieval Europe. In 1054, the eastern branch of Christianity, led by the Patriarch of Constantinople (a title that because roughly equivalent to the western Church&#8217;s pope), established its center in Constantinople and adopted the Greek language for its services. The western branch, under the pope, remained in Rome, becoming known as the Roman Catholic Church and continuing to use Latin. Following this split, known as the Great Schism, each branch of Christianity maintained a strict organizational hierarchy. The pope in Rome, for example, oversaw a huge bureaucracy led by cardinals, known as &#8220;princes of the church,&#8221; who were followed by archbishops, bishops, and then priests. During this period, the Roman Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe.</p><p id="fs-idm35800992">Just as agrarian life depended on the seasons, village and family life revolved around the Church. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">sacraments</span>, or special ceremonies of the Church, marked every stage of life, from birth to maturation, marriage, and burial, and brought people into the church on a regular basis. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, it replaced pagan and animistic views, explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms. A benevolent God in heaven, creator of the universe and beyond the realm of nature and the known, controlled all events, warring against the force of darkness, known as the Devil or Satan, here on earth. Although ultimately defeated, Satan still had the power to trick humans and cause them to commit evil or sin.</p>
<p id="fs-idm30803792">All events had a spiritual connotation. Sickness, for example, might be a sign that a person had sinned, while crop failure could result from the villagers&#8217; not saying their prayers. Penitents confessed their sins to the priest, who absolved them and assigned them penance to atone for their acts and save themselves from eternal damnation. Thus the parish priest held enormous power over the lives of his parishioners.</p>

<p id="fs-idm90855264">Ultimately, the pope decided all matters of theology, interpreting the will of God to the people, but he also had authority over temporal matters. Because the Church had the ability to excommunicate people, or send a soul to hell forever, even monarchs feared to challenge its power. It was also the seat of all knowledge. Latin, the language of the Church, served as a unifying factor for a continent of isolated regions, each with its own dialect; in the early Middle Ages, nations as we know them today did not yet exist. The mostly illiterate serfs were thus dependent on those literate priests to read and interpret the Bible, the word of God, for them.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm23269648"><h1 data-type="title">CHRISTIANITY ENCOUNTERS ISLAM</h1>

<p id="fs-idm24130096">The year 622 brought a new challenge to Christendom. Near Mecca, Saudi Arabia, a prophet named Muhammad received a revelation that became a cornerstone of the Islamic faith. The <span data-type="term">Koran</span>, which Muhammad wrote in Arabic, contained his message, affirming monotheism but identifying Christ not as God but as a prophet like Moses, Abraham, David, and Muhammad. Following Muhammad&#8217;s death in 632, Islam spread by both conversion and military conquest across the Middle East and Asia Minor to India and northern Africa, crossing the Straits of Gibraltar into Spain in the year 711 (<a href="#CNX_History_01_02_Islam" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_01_02_Islam"><figcaption>In the seventh and eighth centuries, Islam spread quickly across North Africa and into the Middle East. The religion arrived in Europe via Spain in 711 and remained there until 1492, when Catholic monarchs reconquered the last of Muslim-held territory after a long war.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm44305728" data-alt="A map shows the spread of Islam, including Islamic territory under Muhammad from 622 to 632, which includes present-day Saudi Arabia and Yemen; territory gained from 632 to 661, which includes much of today&#8217;s Middle East; and territory gained from 661 to 750, which includes present-day Spain and Portugal.

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm65295680">The Islamic conquest of Europe continued until 732. Then, at the Battle of Tours (in modern France), Charles Martel, nicknamed the Hammer, led a Christian force in defeating the army of Abdul Rahman al-Ghafiqi. Muslims, however, retained control of much of Spain, where C&#243;rdoba, known for leather and wool production, became a major center of learning and trade. By the eleventh century, a major Christian holy war called the <span data-type="term">Reconquista</span>, or reconquest, had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain. This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land (the Biblical region of Palestine), known as the <span data-type="term">Crusades</span>.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm53534544"><h1 data-type="title">JERUSALEM AND THE CRUSADES</h1>
<p id="fs-idm83486704">The city of Jerusalem is a holy site for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It was here King Solomon built the Temple in the tenth century BCE. It was here the Romans crucified Jesus in 33 CE, and from here, Christians maintain, he ascended into heaven, promising to return. From here, Muslims believe, Muhammad traveled to heaven in 621 to receive instructions about prayer. Thus claims on the area go deep, and emotions about it run high, among followers of all three faiths. Evidence exists that the three religions lived in harmony for centuries. In 1095, however, European Christians decided not only to retake the holy city from the Muslim rulers but also to conquer what they called the Holy Lands, an area that extended from modern-day Turkey in the north along the Mediterranean coast to the Sinai Peninsula and that was also held by Muslims. The Crusades had begun.</p>
<p id="fs-idm44743216">Religious zeal motivated the knights who participated in the four Crusades. Adventure, the chance to win land and a title, and the Church&#8217;s promise of wholesale forgiveness of sins also motivated many. The Crusaders, mostly French knights, retook Jerusalem in June 1099 amid horrific slaughter. A French writer who accompanied them recorded this eyewitness account: &#8220;On the top of Solomon&#8217;s Temple, to which they had climbed in fleeing, many were shot to death with arrows and cast down headlong from the roof. Within this Temple, about ten thousand were beheaded. If you had been there, your feet would have been stained up to the ankles with the blood of the slain. What more shall I tell? Not one of them was allowed to live. They did not spare the women and children.&#8221; A Muslim eyewitness also described how the conquerors stripped the temple of its wealth and looted private homes.</p>
<p id="fs-idm39068160">In 1187, under the legendary leader Saladin, Muslim forces took back the city. Reaction from Europe was swift as King Richard I of England, the Lionheart, joined others to mount yet another action. The battle for the Holy Lands did not conclude until the Crusaders lost their Mediterranean stronghold at Acre (in present-day Israel) in 1291 and the last of the Christians left the area a few years later.</p>
<p id="fs-idm86971376">The Crusades had lasting effects, both positive and negative. On the negative side, the wide-scale persecution of Jews began. Christians classed them with the infidel Muslims and labeled them &#8220;the killers of Christ.&#8221; In the coming centuries, kings either expelled Jews from their kingdoms or forced them to pay heavy tributes for the privilege of remaining. Muslim-Christian hatred also festered, and intolerance grew.</p>
<p id="fs-idm38479472">On the positive side, maritime trade between East and West expanded. As Crusaders experienced the feel of silk, the taste of spices, and the utility of porcelain, desire for these products created new markets for merchants. In particular, the Adriatic port city of Venice prospered enormously from trade with Islamic merchants. Merchants&#8217; ships brought Europeans valuable goods, traveling between the port cities of western Europe and the East from the tenth century on, along routes collectively labeled the Silk Road. From the days of the early adventurer Marco Polo, Venetian sailors had traveled to ports on the Black Sea and established their own colonies along the Mediterranean Coast. However, transporting goods along the old Silk Road was costly, slow, and unprofitable. Muslim middlemen collected taxes as the goods changed hands. Robbers waited to ambush the treasure-laden caravans. A direct water route to the East, cutting out the land portion of the trip, had to be found. As well as seeking a water passage to the wealthy cities in the East, sailors wanted to find a route to the exotic and wealthy Spice Islands in modern-day Indonesia, whose location was kept secret by Muslim rulers. Longtime rivals of Venice, the merchants of Genoa and Florence also looked west.</p></section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp6882560"><h1 data-type="title">THE IBERIAN PENINSULA</h1>
<p id="fs-idm51952816">Although Norse explorers such as Leif Ericson, the son of Eric the Red who first settled Greenland, had reached and established a colony in northern Canada roughly five hundred years prior to Christopher Columbus&#8217;s voyage, it was explorers sailing for Portugal and Spain who traversed the Atlantic throughout the fifteenth century and ushered in an unprecedented age of exploration and permanent contact with North America.</p>
<p id="fs-idm40981952">Located on the extreme western edge of Europe, Portugal, with its port city of Lisbon, soon became the center for merchants desiring to undercut the Venetians&#8217; hold on trade. With a population of about one million and supported by its ruler Prince Henry, whom historians call &#8220;the Navigator,&#8221; this independent kingdom fostered exploration of and trade with western Africa. Skilled shipbuilders and navigators who took advantage of maps from all over Europe, Portuguese sailors used triangular sails and built lighter vessels called caravels that could sail down the African coast.</p>
<p id="fs-idm117164112">Just to the east of Portugal, King Ferdinand of Aragon married Queen Isabella of Castile in 1469, uniting two of the most powerful independent kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula and laying the foundation for the modern nation of Spain. Isabella, motivated by strong religious zeal, was instrumental in beginning the <span data-type="term">Inquisition</span> in 1480, a brutal campaign to root out Jews and Muslims who had seemingly converted to Christianity but secretly continued to practice their faith, as well as other heretics. This powerful couple ruled for the next twenty-five years, centralizing authority and funding exploration and trade with the East. One of their daughters, Catherine of Aragon, became the first wife of King Henry VIII of England.</p>

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idm18673344" class="note history americana" data-label="Americana"><div data-type="title" class="title">Motives for European Exploration</div>
<p id="fs-idm71273584">Historians generally recognize three motives for European exploration&#8212;God, glory, and gold. Particularly in the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal, religious zeal motivated the rulers to make converts and retake land from the Muslims. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal described his &#8220;great desire to make increase in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ and to bring him all the souls that should be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idm53685184">Sailors&#8217; tales about fabulous monsters and fantasy literature about exotic worlds filled with gold, silver, and jewels captured the minds of men who desired to explore these lands and return with untold wealth and the glory of adventure and discovery. They sparked the imagination of merchants like Marco Polo, who made the long and dangerous trip to the realm of the great Mongol ruler Kublai Khan in 1271. The story of his trip, printed in a book entitled <em data-effect="italics">Travels</em>, inspired Columbus, who had a copy in his possession during his voyage more than two hundred years later. Passages such as the following, which describes China&#8217;s imperial palace, are typical of the <em data-effect="italics">Travels</em>:</p>
<p id="fs-idm15079904"><blockquote id="fs-idm74948448">You must know that it is the greatest Palace that ever was. . . . The roof is very lofty, and the walls of the Palace are all covered with gold and silver. They are also adorned with representations of dragons [sculptured and gilt], beasts and birds, knights and idols, and sundry other subjects. And on the ceiling too you see nothing but gold and silver and painting. [On each of the four sides there is a great marble staircase leading to the top of the marble wall, and forming the approach to the Palace.]</blockquote>
<blockquote id="fs-idm13579600">The hall of the Palace is so large that it could easily dine 6,000 people; and it is quite a marvel to see how many rooms there are besides. The building is altogether so vast, so rich, and so beautiful, that no man on earth could design anything superior to it. The outside of the roof also is all colored with vermilion and yellow and green and blue and other hues, which are fixed with a varnish so fine and exquisite that they shine like crystal, and lend a resplendent lustre to the Palace as seen for a great way round. This roof is made too with such strength and solidity that it is fit to last forever.</blockquote></p><p id="fs-idm39105120">Why might a travel account like this one have influenced an explorer like Columbus? What does this tell us about European explorers&#8217; motivations and goals?</p>
</div>
<p id="fs-idm42683488">The year 1492 witnessed some of the most significant events of Ferdinand and Isabella&#8217;s reign. The couple oversaw the final expulsion of North African Muslims (Moors) from the Kingdom of Granada, bringing the nearly eight-hundred-year Reconquista to an end. In this same year, they also ordered all unconverted Jews to leave Spain.</p>
<p id="fs-idm29150256">Also in 1492, after six years of lobbying, a Genoese sailor named Christopher Columbus persuaded the monarchs to fund his expedition to the Far East. Columbus had already pitched his plan to the rulers of Genoa and Venice without success, so the Spanish monarchy was his last hope. Christian zeal was the prime motivating factor for Isabella, as she imagined her faith spreading to the East. Ferdinand, the more practical of the two, hoped to acquire wealth from trade.</p>
<p id="fs-idm76504896">Most educated individuals at the time knew the earth was round, so Columbus&#8217;s plan to reach the East by sailing west was plausible. Though the calculations of Earth&#8217;s circumference made by the Greek geographer Eratosthenes in the second century BCE were known (and, as we now know, nearly accurate), most scholars did not believe they were dependable. Thus Columbus would have no way of knowing when he had traveled far enough around the Earth to reach his goal&#8212;and in fact, Columbus greatly underestimated the Earth&#8217;s circumference.</p>

<p id="fs-idm112242576">In August 1492, Columbus set sail with his three small caravels (<a href="#CNX_History_01_02_Caravels" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). After a voyage of about three thousand miles lasting six weeks, he landed on an island in the Bahamas named Guanahani by the native Lucayans. He promptly christened it San Salvador, the name it bears today.</p>

A lively trade subsequently developed along a variety of routes known collectively as the Silk Road to supply the demand for these products. Brigands and greedy middlemen made the trip along this route expensive and dangerous. By 1492, Europe&#8212;recovered from the Black Death and in search of new products and new wealth&#8212;was anxious to improve trade and communications with the rest of the world. Venice and Genoa led the way in trading with the East. The lure of profit pushed explorers to seek new trade routes to the Spice Islands and eliminate Muslim middlemen.</p>
<p id="fs-idm27658784">Portugal, under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator, attempted to send ships around the continent of Africa. Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile hired Columbus to find a route to the East by going west. As strong supporters of the Catholic Church, they sought to bring Christianity to the East and any newly found lands, as well as hoping to find sources of wealth.</p>

<p id="fs-idp32971424">It is difficult to generalize about West Africa, which was linked to the rise and diffusion of Islam. This geographical unit, central to the rise of the Atlantic World, stretches from modern-day Mauritania to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and encompasses lush rainforests along the equator, savannas on either side of the forest, and much drier land to the north. Until about 600 CE, most Africans were hunter-gatherers. Where water was too scarce for farming, herders maintained sheep, goats, cattle, or camels. In the more heavily wooded area near the equator, farmers raised yams, palm products, or plantains. The savanna areas yielded rice, millet, and sorghum. Sub-Saharan Africans had little experience in maritime matters. Most of the population lived away from the coast, which is connected to the interior by five main rivers&#8212;the Senegal, Gambia, Niger, Volta, and Congo.</p>
<p id="fs-idp34241472">Although there were large trading centers along these rivers, most West Africans lived in small villages and identified with their extended family or their clan. Wives, children, and dependents (including slaves) were a sign of wealth among men, and <span data-type="term">polygyny</span>, the practice of having more than one wife at a time, was widespread. In time of need, relatives, however far away, were counted upon to assist in supplying food or security. Because of the clannish nature of African society, &#8220;we&#8221; was associated with the village and family members, while &#8220;they&#8221; included everyone else. Hundreds of separate dialects emerged; in modern Nigeria, nearly five hundred are still spoken.</p>

<p id="fs-idp30364064">Following the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, Islam continued to spread quickly across North Africa, bringing not only a unifying faith but a political and legal structure as well. As lands fell under the control of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Muslim</span> armies, they instituted Islamic rule and legal structures as local chieftains converted, usually under penalty of death. Only those who had converted to Islam could rule or be engaged in trade. The first major empire to emerge in West Africa was the Ghana Empire (<a href="#CNX_History_01_03_AfricanEmp" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). By 750, the Soninke farmers of the sub-Sahara had become wealthy by taxing the trade that passed through their area. For instance, the Niger River basin supplied gold to the Berber and Arab traders from west of the Nile Valley, who brought cloth, weapons, and manufactured goods into the interior. Huge Saharan salt mines supplied the life-sustaining mineral to the Mediterranean coast of Africa and inland areas. By 900, the monotheistic Muslims controlled most of this trade and had converted many of the African ruling elite. The majority of the population, however, maintained their tribal animistic practices, which gave living attributes to nonliving objects such as mountains, rivers, and wind. Because Ghana&#8217;s king controlled the gold supply, he was able to maintain price controls and afford a strong military. Soon, however, a new kingdom emerged.</p>

<p id="fs-idp61420240">By 1200 CE, under the leadership of Sundiata Keita, Mali had replaced Ghana as the leading state in West Africa. After Sundiata&#8217;s rule, the court converted to Islam, and Muslim scribes played a large part in administration and government. Miners then discovered huge new deposits of gold east of the Niger River. By the fourteenth century, the empire was so wealthy that while on a <em data-effect="italics">hajj</em>, or pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Mali&#8217;s ruler Mansu Musa gave away enough gold to create serious price inflation in the cities along his route. Timbuktu, the capital city, became a leading Islamic center for education, commerce and the slave trade. Meanwhile, in the east, the city of Gao became increasingly strong under the leadership of Sonni Ali and soon eclipsed Mali&#8217;s power. Timbuktu sought Ali&#8217;s assistance in repelling the Tuaregs from the north. By 1500, however, the Tuareg empire of Songhay had eclipsed Mali, where weak and ineffective leadership prevailed.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp100745584"><h1 data-type="title">THE ROLE OF SLAVERY</h1>
<p id="fs-idp97591376">The institution of slavery is not a recent phenomenon. Most civilizations have practiced some form of human bondage and servitude, and African empires were no different (<a href="#CNX_History_01_03_Coffles" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Famine or fear of stronger enemies might force one tribe to ask another for help and give themselves in a type of bondage in exchange. Similar to the European serf system, those seeking protection, or relief from starvation, would become the servants of those who provided relief. Debt might also be worked off through a form of servitude. Typically, these servants became a part of the extended tribal family. There is some evidence of <span data-type="term">chattel slavery</span>, in which people are treated as personal property to be bought and sold, in the Nile Valley. It appears there was a slave-trade route through the Sahara that brought sub-Saharan Africans to Rome, which had slaves from all over the world.</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_01_03_Coffles"><figcaption>Traders with a group of slaves. Note how the slaves are connected at the neck. Muslim traders brought slaves to the North African coast, where they might be sent to Europe or other parts of Africa.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp72889040" data-alt="An illustration shows traders transporting a group of slaves, who are connected at the neck and bound at the wrists.">

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm23433168">Arab slave trading, which exchanged slaves for goods from the Mediterranean, existed long before Islam&#8217;s spread across North Africa. Muslims later expanded this trade and enslaved not only Africans but also Europeans, especially from Spain, Sicily, and Italy. Male captives were forced to build coastal fortifications and serve as galley slaves. Women were added to the harem.</p>

<p id="fs-idp69568192">The major European slave trade began with Portugal&#8217;s exploration of the west coast of Africa in search of a trade route to the East. By 1444, slaves were being brought from Africa to work on the sugar plantations of the Madeira Islands, off the coast of modern Morocco. The slave trade then expanded greatly as European colonies in the New World demanded an ever-increasing number of workers for the extensive plantations growing tobacco, sugar, and eventually rice and cotton (<a href="#CNX_History_01_03_SlaveRoute" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_01_03_SlaveRoute"><figcaption>This map shows the routes that were used in the course of the slave trade and the number of enslaved people who traveled each route. As the figures indicate, most African slaves were bound for Brazil and the Caribbean. While West Africans made up the vast majority of the enslaved, the east coast of Africa, too, supplied slaves for the trade.</figcaption>

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idp62005680">In the New World, the institution of slavery assumed a new aspect when the mercantilist system demanded a permanent, identifiable, and plentiful labor supply. African slaves were both easily identified (by their skin color) and plentiful, because of the thriving slave trade. This led to a race-based slavery system in the New World unlike any bondage system that had come before. Initially, the Spanish tried to force Indians to farm their crops. Most Spanish and Portuguese settlers coming to the New World were gentlemen and did not perform physical labor. They came to &#8220;serve God, but also to get rich,&#8221; as noted by Bernal D&#237;az del Castillo. However, enslaved natives tended to sicken or die from disease or from the overwork and cruel treatment they were subjected to, and so the indigenous peoples proved not to be a dependable source of labor. Although he later repented of his ideas, the great defender of the Indians, Bartolom&#233; de Las Casas, seeing the near extinction of the native population, suggested the Spanish send black (and white) laborers to the Indies. These workers proved hardier, and within fifty years, a change took place: The profitability of the African slave trade, coupled with the seemingly limitless number of potential slaves and the Catholic Church&#8217;s denunciation of the enslavement of Christians, led race to become a dominant factor in the institution of slavery.</p>
<p id="fs-idp46642480">In the English colonies along the Atlantic coast, indentured servants initially filled the need for labor in the North, where family farms were the norm. In the South, however, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco, rice, and indigo prevailed, and eventually the supply of indentured servants was insufficient to meet the demand. These workers served only for periods of three to seven years before being freed; a more permanent labor supply was needed. Thus, whereas in Africa permanent, inherited slavery was unknown, and children of those bound in slavery to the tribe usually were free and intermarried with their captors, this changed in the Americas; slavery became permanent, and children born to slaves became slaves. This development, along with slavery&#8217;s identification with race, forever changed the institution and shaped its unique character in the New World.</p>

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idp31167920" class="note history americana" data-label="Americana"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Beginnings of Racial Slavery</div>
<p id="fs-idp64526448">Slavery has a long history. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle posited that some peoples were <em data-effect="italics">homunculi</em>, or humanlike but not really people&#8212;for instance, if they did not speak Greek. Both the Bible and the Koran sanction slavery. Vikings who raided from Ireland to Russia brought back slaves of all nationalities. During the Middle Ages, traders from the interior of Africa brought slaves along well-established routes to sell them along the Mediterranean coast. Initially, slavers also brought European slaves to the Caribbean. Many of these were orphaned or homeless children captured in the cities of Ireland. The question is, when did slavery become based on race? This appears to have developed in the New World, with the introduction of gruelingly labor-intensive crops such as sugar and coffee. Unable to fill their growing need from the ranks of prisoners or indentured servants, the European colonists turned to African laborers. The Portuguese, although seeking a trade route to India, also set up forts along the West African coast for the purpose of exporting slaves to Europe. Historians believe that by the year 1500, 10 percent of the population of Lisbon and Seville consisted of black slaves. Because of the influence of the Catholic Church, which frowned on the enslavement of Christians, European slave traders expanded their reach down the coast of Africa.</p>
<p id="fs-idp65056512">When Europeans settled Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America, they thus established a system of racially based slavery. Here, the need for a massive labor force was greater than in western Europe. The land was ripe for growing sugar, coffee, rice, and ultimately cotton. To fulfill the ever-growing demand for these crops, large plantations were created. The success of these plantations depended upon the availability of a permanent, plentiful, identifiable, and skilled labor supply. As Africans were already familiar with animal husbandry as well as farming, had an identifying skin color, and could be readily supplied by the existing African slave trade, they proved the answer to this need. This process set the stage for the expansion of New World slavery into North America.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idp62170928">Before 1492, Africa, like the Americas, had experienced the rise and fall of many cultures, but the continent did not develop a centralized authority structure. African peoples practiced various forms of slavery, all of which differed significantly from the racial slavery that ultimately developed in the New World. After the arrival of Islam and before the Portuguese came to the coast of West Africa in 1444, Muslims controlled the slave trade out of Africa, which expanded as European powers began to colonize the New World. Driven by a demand for labor, slavery in the Americas developed a new form: It was based on race, and the status of slave was both permanent and inherited.</p>

<p id="fs-idm6113792">The story of the Atlantic World is the story of global migration, a migration driven in large part by the actions and aspirations of the ruling heads of Europe. Columbus is hardly visible in this illustration of his ships making landfall on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (<a href="#CNX_History_02_00_Ferdinand" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Instead, Ferdinand II of Spain (in the foreground) sits on his throne and points toward Columbus&#8217;s landing. As the ships arrive, the Arawak people tower over the Spanish, suggesting the native population density of the islands.</p>

<p id="fs-idp1690448">This historic moment in 1492 sparked new rivalries among European powers as they scrambled to create New World colonies, fueled by the quest for wealth and power as well as by religious passions. Almost continuous war resulted. Spain achieved early preeminence, creating a far-flung empire and growing rich with treasures from the Americas. Native Americans who confronted the newcomers from Europe suffered unprecedented losses of life, however, as previously unknown diseases sliced through their populations. They also were victims of the arrogance of the Europeans, who viewed themselves as uncontested masters of the New World, sent by God to bring Christianity to the &#8220;Indians.&#8221; </p></div><div data-type="page"><div data-type="document-title">Portuguese Exploration and Spanish Conquest</div><div data-type="abstract">By the end of this section, you will be able to:

<p id="fs-idm11244032">Portuguese colonization of Atlantic islands in the 1400s inaugurated an era of aggressive European expansion across the Atlantic. In the 1500s, Spain surpassed Portugal as the dominant European power. This age of exploration and the subsequent creation of an Atlantic World marked the earliest phase of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">globalization</span>, in which previously isolated groups&#8212;Africans, Native Americans, and Europeans&#8212;first came into contact with each other, sometimes with disastrous results.</p> 

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp7810656"><h1 data-type="title">PORTUGUESE EXPLORATION</h1>
<p id="fs-idp22923216">Portugal&#8217;s Prince Henry the Navigator spearheaded his country&#8217;s exploration of Africa and the Atlantic in the 1400s. With his support, Portuguese mariners successfully navigated an eastward route to Africa, establishing a foothold there that became a foundation of their nation&#8217;s trade empire in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p id="fs-idm264176">Portuguese mariners built an Atlantic empire by colonizing the Canary, Cape Verde, and Azores Islands, as well as the island of Madeira. Merchants then used these Atlantic outposts as debarkation points for subsequent journeys. From these strategic points, Portugal spread its empire down the western coast of Africa to the Congo, along the western coast of India, and eventually to Brazil on the eastern coast of South America. It also established trading posts in China and Japan. While the Portuguese didn&#8217;t rule over an immense landmass, their strategic holdings of islands and coastal ports gave them almost unrivaled control of nautical trade routes and a global empire of trading posts during the 1400s.</p>

<p id="fs-idp4725568">The travels of Portuguese traders to western Africa introduced them to the African slave trade, already brisk among African states. Seeing the value of this source of labor in growing the profitable crop of sugar on their Atlantic islands, the Portuguese soon began exporting African slaves along with African ivory and gold. Sugar fueled the Atlantic slave trade, and the Portuguese islands quickly became home to sugar plantations. The Portuguese also traded these slaves, introducing much-needed human capital to other European nations. In the following years, as European exploration spread, slavery spread as well. In time, much of the Atlantic World would become a gargantuan sugar-plantation complex in which Africans labored to produce the highly profitable commodity for European consumers.</p>

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idp7428096" class="note history americana" data-label="Americana"><div data-type="title" class="title">Elmina Castle</div>
<p id="fs-idm1516608">In 1482, Portuguese traders built Elmina Castle (also called S&#227;o Jorge da Mina, or Saint George&#8217;s of the Mine) in present-day Ghana, on the west coast of Africa (<a href="#CNX_History_02_01_Elmina" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A fortified trading post, it had mounted cannons facing out to sea, not inland toward continental Africa; the Portuguese had greater fear of a naval attack from other Europeans than of a land attack from Africans. Portuguese traders soon began to settle around the fort and established the town of Elmina.</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_01_Elmina"><figcaption>Elmina Castle on the west coast of Ghana was used as a holding pen for slaves before they were brought across the Atlantic and sold. Originally built by the Portuguese in the fifteenth century, it appears in this image as it was in the 1660s, after being seized by Dutch slave traders in 1637.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm7795360" data-alt="A painting shows Elmina Castle, which is flying the Dutch flag.">

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idp10442400">Although the Portuguese originally used the fort primarily for trading gold, by the sixteenth century they had shifted their focus. The dungeon of the fort now served as a holding pen for African slaves from the interior of the continent, while on the upper floors Portuguese traders ate, slept, and prayed in a chapel. Slaves lived in the dungeon for weeks or months until ships arrived to transport them to Europe or the Americas. For them, the dungeon of Elmina was their last sight of their home country.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp30350448"><h1 data-type="title">SPANISH EXPLORATION AND CONQUEST</h1>
<p id="fs-idp45134944">The Spanish established the first European settlements in the Americas, beginning in the Caribbean and, by 1600, extending throughout Central and South America. Thousands of Spaniards flocked to the Americas seeking wealth and status. The most famous of these Spanish adventurers are Christopher Columbus (who, though Italian himself, explored on behalf of the Spanish monarchs), Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s, and Francisco Pizarro.</p>

<p id="fs-idp36009680">The history of Spanish exploration begins with the history of Spain itself. During the fifteenth century, Spain hoped to gain advantage over its rival, Portugal. The marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469 unified Catholic Spain and began the process of building a nation that could compete for worldwide power. Since the 700s, much of Spain had been under Islamic rule, and King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I, arch-defenders of the Catholic Church against Islam, were determined to defeat the Muslims in Granada, the last Islamic stronghold in Spain. In 1492, they completed the Reconquista: the centuries-long Christian conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista marked another step forward in the process of making Spain an imperial power, and Ferdinand and Isabella were now ready to look further afield.</p>

<p id="fs-idp19309376">Their goals were to expand Catholicism and to gain a commercial advantage over Portugal. To those ends, Ferdinand and Isabella sponsored extensive Atlantic exploration. Spain&#8217;s most famous explorer, Christopher Columbus, was actually from Genoa, Italy. He believed that, using calculations based on other mariners&#8217; journeys, he could chart a westward route to India, which could be used to expand European trade and spread Christianity. Starting in 1485, he approached Genoese, Venetian, Portuguese, English, and Spanish monarchs, asking for ships and funding to explore this westward route. All those he petitioned&#8212;including Ferdinand and Isabella at first&#8212;rebuffed him; their nautical experts all concurred that Columbus&#8217;s estimates of the width of the Atlantic Ocean were far too low. However, after three years of entreaties, and, more important, the completion of the Reconquista, Ferdinand and Isabella agreed to finance Columbus&#8217;s expedition in 1492, supplying him with three ships: the <em data-effect="italics">Nina</em>, the <em data-effect="italics">Pinta</em>, and the <em data-effect="italics">Santa Maria</em>. The Spanish monarchs knew that Portuguese mariners had reached the southern tip of Africa and sailed the Indian Ocean. They understood that the Portuguese would soon reach Asia and, in this competitive race to reach the Far East, the Spanish rulers decided to act.</p>

<p id="fs-idp22148656">Columbus held erroneous views that shaped his thinking about what he would encounter as he sailed west. He believed the earth to be much smaller than its actual size and, since he did not know of the existence of the Americas, he fully expected to land in Asia. On October 12, 1492, however, he made landfall on an island in the Bahamas. He then sailed to an island he named <span data-type="term">Hispaniola</span> (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) (<a href="#CNX_History_02_01_Hispaniola" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Believing he had landed in the East Indies, Columbus called the native Ta&#237;nos he found there &#8220;Indios,&#8221; giving rise to the term &#8220;Indian&#8221; for any native people of the New World. Upon Columbus&#8217;s return to Spain, the Spanish crown bestowed on him the title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and named him governor and viceroy of the lands he had discovered. As a devoted Catholic, Columbus had agreed with Ferdinand and Isabella prior to sailing west that part of the expected wealth from his voyage would be used to continue the fight against Islam.</p>

<p id="fs-idp9153520">Columbus&#8217;s 1493 letter&#8212;or <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">probanza de m&#233;rito</em></span> (proof of merit)&#8212;describing his &#8220;discovery&#8221; of a New World did much to inspire excitement in Europe. <em data-effect="italics">Probanzas de m&#233;ritos</em> were reports and letters written by Spaniards in the New World to the Spanish crown, designed to win royal patronage. Today they highlight the difficult task of historical work; while the letters are primary sources, historians need to understand the context and the culture in which the conquistadors, as the Spanish adventurers came to be called, wrote them and distinguish their bias and subjective nature. While they are filled with distortions and fabrications, <em data-effect="italics">probanzas de m&#233;ritos</em> are still useful in illustrating the expectation of wealth among the explorers as well as their view that native peoples would not pose a serious obstacle to colonization.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11735696">In 1493, Columbus sent two copies of a <em data-effect="italics">probanza de m&#233;rito</em> to the Spanish king and queen and their minister of finance, Luis de Sant&#225;ngel. Sant&#225;ngel had supported Columbus&#8217;s voyage, helping him to obtain funding from Ferdinand and Isabella. Copies of the letter were soon circulating all over Europe, spreading news of the wondrous new land that Columbus had &#8220;discovered.&#8221; Columbus would make three more voyages over the next decade, establishing Spain&#8217;s first settlement in the New World on the island of Hispaniola. Many other Europeans followed in Columbus&#8217;s footsteps, drawn by dreams of winning wealth by sailing west. Another Italian, Amerigo Vespucci, sailing for the Portuguese crown, explored the South American coastline between 1499 and 1502. Unlike Columbus, he realized that the Americas were not part of Asia but lands unknown to Europeans. Vespucci&#8217;s widely published accounts of his voyages fueled speculation and intense interest in the New World among Europeans. Among those who read Vespucci&#8217;s reports was the German mapmaker Martin Waldseemuller. Using the explorer&#8217;s first name as a label for the new landmass, Waldseemuller attached &#8220;America&#8221; to his map of the New World in 1507, and the name stuck.</p>

<p id="fs-idm71025872">The exploits of the most famous Spanish explorers have provided Western civilization with a narrative of European supremacy and Indian savagery. However, these stories are based on the self-aggrandizing efforts of conquistadors to secure royal favor through the writing of <em data-effect="italics">probanzas de m&#233;ritos</em> (proofs of merit). Below are excerpts from Columbus&#8217;s 1493 letter to Luis de Sant&#225;ngel, which illustrates how fantastic reports from European explorers gave rise to many myths surrounding the Spanish conquest and the New World.</p>

<p id="fs-idm41338384">
<blockquote id="fs-idm45251184">This island, like all the others, is most extensive. It has many ports along the sea-coast excelling any in Christendom&#8212;and many fine, large, flowing rivers. The land there is elevated, with many mountains and peaks incomparably higher than in the centre isle. They are most beautiful, of a thousand varied forms, accessible, and full of trees of endless varieties, so high that they seem to touch the sky, and I have been told that they never lose their foliage. . . . There is honey, and there are many kinds of birds, and a great variety of fruits. Inland there are numerous mines of metals and innumerable people. Hispaniola is a marvel. Its hills and mountains, fine plains and open country, are rich and fertile for planting and for pasturage, and for building towns and villages. The seaports there are incredibly fine, as also the magnificent rivers, most of which bear gold. The trees, fruits and grasses differ widely from those in Juana. There are many spices and vast mines of gold and other metals in this island. They have no iron, nor steel, nor weapons, nor are they fit for them, because although they are well-made men of commanding stature, they appear extraordinarily timid. The only arms they have are sticks of cane, cut when in seed, with a sharpened stick at the end, and they are afraid to use these. Often I have sent two or three men ashore to some town to converse with them, and the natives came out in great numbers, and as soon as they saw our men arrive, fled without a moment&#8217;s delay although I protected them from all injury.</blockquote></p>

<p id="fs-idm72502464">What does this letter show us about Spanish objectives in the New World? How do you think it might have influenced Europeans reading about the New World for the first time?</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idm105578528">The 1492 Columbus landfall accelerated the rivalry between Spain and Portugal, and the two powers vied for domination through the acquisition of new lands. In the 1480s, Pope Sixtus IV had granted Portugal the right to all land south of the Cape Verde islands, leading the Portuguese king to claim that the lands discovered by Columbus belonged to Portugal, not Spain. Seeking to ensure that Columbus&#8217;s finds would remain Spanish, Spain&#8217;s monarchs turned to the Spanish-born Pope Alexander VI, who issued two papal decrees in 1493 that gave legitimacy to Spain&#8217;s Atlantic claims at the expense of Portugal. Hoping to salvage Portugal&#8217;s Atlantic holdings, King Jo&#227;o II began negotiations with Spain. The resulting Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 drew a north-to-south line through South America (<a href="#CNX_History_02_01_Tordesilla" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>); Spain gained territory west of the line, while Portugal retained the lands east of the line, including the east coast of Brazil.</p>

The map shows areas of Portuguese and Spanish exploration, the two nations&#8217; claims under the Treaty of Tordesillas, and a variety of flora, fauna, figures, and structures.

<p id="fs-idm34824048">Columbus&#8217;s discovery opened a floodgate of Spanish exploration. Inspired by tales of rivers of gold and timid, malleable natives, later Spanish explorers were relentless in their quest for land and gold. Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s hoped to gain hereditary privilege for his family, tribute payments and labor from natives, and an annual pension for his service to the crown. Cort&#233;s arrived on Hispaniola in 1504 and took part in the conquest of that island. In anticipation of winning his own honor and riches, Cort&#233;s later explored the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula. In 1519, he entered Tenochtitl&#225;n, the capital of the Aztec (Mexica) Empire. He and his men were astonished by the incredibly sophisticated causeways, gardens, and temples in the city, but they were horrified by the practice of human sacrifice that was part of the Aztec religion. Above all else, the Aztec wealth in gold fascinated the Spanish adventurers.</p>

<p id="fs-idm54122752">Hoping to gain power over the city, Cort&#233;s took Moctezuma, the Aztec ruler, hostage. The Spanish then murdered hundreds of high-ranking Mexica during a festival to celebrate Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. This angered the people of Tenochtitl&#225;n, who rose up against the interlopers in their city. Cort&#233;s and his people fled for their lives, running down one of Tenochtitl&#225;n&#8217;s causeways to safety on the shore. Smarting from their defeat at the hands of the Aztec, Cort&#233;s slowly created alliances with native peoples who resented Aztec rule. It took nearly a year for the Spanish and the tens of thousands of native allies who joined them to defeat the Mexica in Tenochtitl&#225;n, which they did by laying siege to the city. Only by playing upon the disunity among the diverse groups in the Aztec Empire were the Spanish able to capture the grand city of Tenochtitl&#225;n. In August 1521, having successfully fomented civil war as well as fended off rival Spanish explorers, Cort&#233;s claimed Tenochtitl&#225;n for Spain and renamed it Mexico City.</p>

<p id="fs-idm100584944">The traditional European narrative of exploration presents the victory of the Spanish over the Aztec as an example of the superiority of the Europeans over the savage Indians. However, the reality is far more complex. When Cort&#233;s explored central Mexico, he encountered a region simmering with native conflict. Far from being unified and content under Aztec rule, many peoples in Mexico resented it and were ready to rebel. One group in particular, the Tlaxcalan, threw their lot in with the Spanish, providing as many as 200,000 fighters in the siege of Tenochtitl&#225;n. The Spanish also brought smallpox into the valley of Mexico. The disease took a heavy toll on the people in Tenochtitl&#225;n, playing a much greater role in the city&#8217;s demise than did Spanish force of arms.</p>

<p id="fs-idm48146752">Cort&#233;s was also aided by a Nahua woman called Malintzin (also known as La Malinche or Do&#241;a Marina, her Spanish name), whom the natives of Tabasco gave him as tribute. Malintzin translated for Cort&#233;s in his dealings with Moctezuma and, whether willingly or under pressure, entered into a physical relationship with him. Their son, Mart&#237;n, may have been the first mestizo (person of mixed indigenous American and European descent). Malintzin remains a controversial figure in the history of the Atlantic World; some people view her as a traitor because she helped Cort&#233;s conquer the Aztecs, while others see her as a victim of European expansion. In either case, she demonstrates one way in which native peoples responded to the arrival of the Spanish. Without her, Cort&#233;s would not have been able to communicate, and without the language bridge, he surely would have been less successful in destabilizing the Aztec Empire. By this and other means, native people helped shape the conquest of the Americas.</p>

<p id="fs-idp19324656">Spain&#8217;s acquisitiveness seemingly knew no bounds as groups of its explorers searched for the next trove of instant riches. One such explorer, Francisco Pizarro, made his way to the Spanish Caribbean in 1509, drawn by the promise of wealth and titles. He participated in successful expeditions in Panama before following rumors of Inca wealth to the south. Although his first efforts against the Inca Empire in the 1520s failed, Pizarro captured the Inca emperor Atahualpa in 1532 and executed him one year later. In 1533, Pizarro founded Lima, Peru. Like Cort&#233;s, Pizarro had to combat not only the natives of the new worlds he was conquering, but also competitors from his own country; a Spanish rival assassinated him in 1541.</p>

<p id="fs-idm48487488">Spain&#8217;s drive to enlarge its empire led other hopeful conquistadors to push further into the Americas, hoping to replicate the success of Cort&#233;s and Pizarro. Hernando de Soto had participated in Pizarro&#8217;s conquest of the Inca, and from 1539 to 1542 he led expeditions to what is today the southeastern United States, looking for gold. He and his followers explored what is now Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas. Everywhere they traveled, they brought European diseases, which claimed thousands of native lives as well as the lives of the explorers. In 1542, de Soto himself died during the expedition. The surviving Spaniards, numbering a little over three hundred, returned to Mexico City without finding the much-anticipated mountains of gold and silver.</p>

<p id="fs-idp15806544">Francisco V&#225;squez de Coronado was born into a noble family and went to Mexico, then called New Spain, in 1535. He presided as governor over the province of Nueva Galicia, where he heard rumors of wealth to the north: a golden city called Quivira. Between 1540 and 1542, Coronado led a large expedition of Spaniards and native allies to the lands north of Mexico City, and for the next several years, they explored the area that is now the southwestern United States (<a href="#CNX_History_02_01_Coronado" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). During the winter of 1540&#8211;41, the explorers waged war against the Tiwa in present-day New Mexico. Rather than leading to the discovery of gold and silver, however, the expedition simply left Coronado bankrupt.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm84399120"><h1 data-type="title">THE SPANISH GOLDEN AGE</h1>
<p id="fs-idm40078992">The exploits of European explorers had a profound impact both in the Americas and back in Europe. An exchange of ideas, fueled and financed in part by New World commodities, began to connect European nations and, in turn, to touch the parts of the world that Europeans conquered. In Spain, gold and silver from the Americas helped to fuel a golden age, the Siglo de Oro, when Spanish art and literature flourished. Riches poured in from the colonies, and new ideas poured in from other countries and new lands. The Hapsburg dynasty, which ruled a collection of territories including Austria, the Netherlands, Naples, Sicily, and Spain, encouraged and financed the work of painters, sculptors, musicians, architects, and writers, resulting in a blooming of Spanish Renaissance culture. One of this period&#8217;s most famous works is the novel <em data-effect="italics">The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha</em>, by Miguel de Cervantes. This two-volume book (1605 and 1618) told a colorful tale of an <em data-effect="italics">hidalgo</em> (gentleman) who reads so many tales of chivalry and knighthood that he becomes unable to tell reality from fiction. With his faithful sidekick Sancho Panza, Don Quixote leaves reality behind and sets out to revive chivalry by doing battle with what he perceives as the enemies of Spain.</p>

<p id="fs-idm37201392">Spain attracted innovative foreign painters such as El Greco, a Greek who had studied with Italian Renaissance masters like Titian and Michelangelo before moving to Toledo. Native Spaniards created equally enduring works. <em data-effect="italics">Las Meninas (The Maids of Honor)</em>, painted by Diego Vel&#225;zquez in 1656, is one of the best-known paintings in history. Vel&#225;zquez painted himself into this imposingly large royal portrait (he&#8217;s shown holding his brush and easel on the left) and boldly placed the viewer where the king and queen would stand in the scene (<a href="#CNX_History_02_01_Meninas" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp14712320">Although Portugal opened the door to exploration of the Atlantic World, Spanish explorers quickly made inroads into the Americas. Spurred by Christopher Columbus&#8217;s glowing reports of the riches to be found in the New World, throngs of Spanish conquistadors set off to find and conquer new lands. They accomplished this through a combination of military strength and strategic alliances with native peoples. Spanish rulers Ferdinand and Isabella promoted the acquisition of these new lands in order to strengthen and glorify their own empire. As Spain&#8217;s empire expanded and riches flowed in from the Americas, the Spanish experienced a golden age of art and literature.</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain the changes brought by the Protestant Reformation and how it influenced the development of the Atlantic World</li>
<li>Describe Spain&#8217;s response to the Protestant Reformation</li>
</ul></div>
  
<p id="fs-idm17951472">Until the 1500s, the Catholic Church provided a unifying religious structure for Christian Europe. The Vatican in Rome exercised great power over the lives of Europeans; it controlled not only learning and scholarship but also finances, because it levied taxes on the faithful. Spain, with its New World wealth, was the bastion of the Catholic faith. Beginning with the reform efforts of Martin Luther in 1517 and John Calvin in the 1530s, however, Catholic dominance came under attack as the <span data-type="term">Protestant Reformation</span>, a split or schism among European Christians, began.</p>

<p id="fs-idm78754496">During the sixteenth century, Protestantism spread through northern Europe, and Catholic countries responded by attempting to extinguish what was seen as the Protestant menace. Religious turmoil between Catholics and Protestants influenced the history of the Atlantic World as well, since different nation-states competed not only for control of new territories but also for the preeminence of their religious beliefs there. Just as the history of Spain&#8217;s rise to power is linked to the Reconquista, so too is the history of early globalization connected to the history of competing Christian groups in the Atlantic World.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm6880512"><h1 data-type="title">MARTIN LUTHER</h1>
<p id="fs-idm7063968">Martin Luther (<a href="#CNX_History_02_02_Luther" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) was a German Catholic monk who took issue with the Catholic Church&#8217;s practice of selling <span data-type="term">indulgences</span>, documents that absolved sinners of their errant behavior. He also objected to the Catholic Church&#8217;s taxation of ordinary Germans and the delivery of Mass in Latin, arguing that it failed to instruct German Catholics, who did not understand the language.</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_02_Luther"><figcaption>Martin Luther, a German Catholic monk and leader of the Protestant Reformation, was a close friend of the German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder. Cranach painted this and several other portraits of Luther.</figcaption>

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm6464576">Many Europeans had called for reforms of the Catholic Church before Martin Luther did, but his protest had the unintended consequence of splitting European Christianity. Luther compiled a list of what he viewed as needed Church reforms, a document that came to be known as <em data-effect="italics">The Ninety-Five Theses</em>, and nailed it to the door of a church in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1517. He called for the publication of the Bible in everyday language, took issue with the Church&#8217;s policy of imposing tithes (a required payment to the Church that appeared to enrich the clergy), and denounced the buying and selling of indulgences. Although he had hoped to reform the Catholic Church while remaining a part of it, Luther&#8217;s action instead triggered a movement called the Protestant Reformation that divided the Church in two. The Catholic Church condemned him as a heretic, but a doctrine based on his reforms, called Lutheranism, spread through northern Germany and Scandinavia.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm573216"><h1 data-type="title">JOHN CALVIN</h1>
<p id="fs-idp8861856">Like Luther, the French lawyer John Calvin advocated making the Bible accessible to ordinary people; only by reading scripture and reflecting daily about their spiritual condition, he argued, could believers begin to understand the power of God. In 1535, Calvin fled Catholic France and led the Reformation movement from Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

<p id="fs-idm53395520"><span data-type="term">Calvinism</span> emphasized human powerlessness before an omniscient God and stressed the idea of predestination, the belief that God selected a few chosen people for salvation while everyone else was predestined to damnation. Calvinists believed that reading scripture prepared sinners, if they were among the elect, to receive God&#8217;s grace. In Geneva, Calvin established a Bible commonwealth, a community of believers whose sole source of authority was their interpretation of the Bible, not the authority of any prince or monarch. Soon Calvin&#8217;s ideas spread to the Netherlands and Scotland.</p>
</section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm81548208"><h1 data-type="title">PROTESTANTISM IN ENGLAND</h1>
<p id="fs-idm12515664">Protestantism spread beyond the German states and Geneva to England, which had been a Catholic nation for centuries. Luther&#8217;s idea that scripture should be available in the everyday language of worshippers inspired English scholar William Tyndale to translate the Bible into English in 1526. The seismic break with the Catholic Church in England occurred in the 1530s, when Henry VIII established a new, Protestant state religion.</p>

<p id="fs-idm24655520">A devout Catholic, Henry had initially stood in opposition to the Reformation. Pope Leo X even awarded him the title &#8220;Defender of the Faith.&#8221; The tides turned, however, when Henry desired a male heir to the Tudor monarchy. When his Spanish Catholic wife, Catherine (the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella), did not give birth to a boy, the king sought an annulment to their marriage. When the Pope refused his request, Henry created a new national Protestant church, the Church of England, with himself at its head. This left him free to annul his own marriage and marry Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p id="fs-idm18459600">Anne Boleyn also failed to produce a male heir, and when she was accused of adultery, Henry had her executed. His third wife, Jane Seymour, at long last delivered a son, Edward, who ruled for only a short time before dying in 1553 at the age of fifteen. Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII and his discarded first wife Catherine, then came to the throne, committed to restoring Catholicism. She earned the nickname &#8220;Bloody Mary&#8221; for the many executions of Protestants, often by burning alive, that she ordered during her reign.</p>

<p id="fs-idm86470560">Religious turbulence in England was finally quieted when Elizabeth, the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, ascended the throne in 1558. Under Elizabeth, the Church of England again became the state church, retaining the hierarchical structure and many of the rituals of the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1500s, some English members of the Church began to agitate for more reform. Known as <span data-type="term">Puritans</span>, they worked to erase all vestiges of Catholicism from the Church of England. At the time, the term &#8220;puritan&#8221; was a pejorative one; many people saw Puritans as holier-than-thou frauds who used religion to swindle their neighbors. Worse still, many in power saw Puritans as a security threat because of their opposition to the national church.</p>

<p id="fs-idm12430816">Under Elizabeth, whose long reign lasted from 1558 to 1603, Puritans grew steadily in number. After James I died in 1625 and his son Charles I ascended the throne, Puritans became the target of increasing state pressure to conform. Many crossed the Atlantic in the 1620s and 1630s instead to create a New England, a haven for reformed Protestantism where Puritan was no longer a term of abuse. Thus, the religious upheavals that affected England so much had equally momentous consequences for the Americas.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm11580496"><h1 data-type="title">RELIGIOUS WAR</h1>
<p id="fs-idm36173328">By the early 1500s, the Protestant Reformation threatened the massive Spanish Catholic empire. As the preeminent Catholic power, Spain would not tolerate any challenge to the Holy Catholic Church. Over the course of the 1500s, it devoted vast amounts of treasure and labor to leading an unsuccessful effort to eradicate Protestantism in Europe.</p>

<p id="fs-idp3182000">Spain&#8217;s main enemies at this time were the runaway Spanish provinces of the North Netherlands. By 1581, these seven northern provinces had declared their independence from Spain and created the Dutch Republic, also called Holland, where Protestantism was tolerated. Determined to deal a death blow to Protestantism in England and Holland, King Philip of Spain assembled a massive force of over thirty thousand men and 130 ships, and in 1588 he sent this navy, the Spanish Armada, north. But English sea power combined with a maritime storm destroyed the fleet.</p>

<p id="fs-idp3001296">The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 was but one part of a larger but undeclared war between Protestant England and Catholic Spain. Between 1585 and 1604, the two rivals sparred repeatedly. England launched its own armada in 1589 in an effort to cripple the Spanish fleet and capture Spanish treasure. However, the foray ended in disaster for the English, with storms, disease, and the strength of the Spanish Armada combining to bring about defeat.</p>

<p id="fs-idm5493248">The conflict between Spain and England dragged on into the early seventeenth century, and the newly Protestant nations, especially England and the Dutch Republic, posed a significant challenge to Spain (and also to Catholic France) as imperial rivalries played out in the Atlantic World. Spain retained its mighty American empire, but by the early 1600s, the nation could no longer keep England and other European rivals&#8212;the French and Dutch&#8212;from colonizing smaller islands in the Caribbean (<a href="#CNX_History_02_02_Elizabeth" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp3150288">Religious intolerance characterized the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, an age of powerful state religions with the authority to impose and enforce belief systems on the population. In this climate, religious violence was common. One of the most striking examples is the St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Day Massacre of 1572, in which French Catholic troops began to kill unarmed French Protestants (<a href="#CNX_History_02_02_Bartholo" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The murders touched off mob violence that ultimately claimed nine thousand lives, a bloody episode that highlights the degree of religious turmoil that gripped Europe in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p id="fs-idp40560">The sixteenth century witnessed a new challenge to the powerful Catholic Church. The reformist doctrines of Martin Luther and John Calvin attracted many people dissatisfied with Catholicism, and Protestantism spread across northern Europe, spawning many subgroups with conflicting beliefs. Spain led the charge against Protestantism, leading to decades of undeclared religious wars between Spain and England, and religious intolerance and violence characterized much of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Despite the efforts of the Catholic Church and Catholic nations, however, Protestantism had taken hold by 1600.</p>

<p id="fs-idm50978656">Disruptions during the Tudor monarchy&#8212;especially the creation of the Protestant Church of England by Henry VIII in the 1530s, the return of the nation to Catholicism under Queen Mary in the 1550s, and the restoration of Protestantism under Queen Elizabeth&#8212;left England with little energy for overseas projects. More important, England lacked the financial resources for such endeavors. Nonetheless, English monarchs carefully monitored developments in the new Atlantic World and took steps to assert England&#8217;s claim to the Americas. As early as 1497, Henry VII of England had commissioned John Cabot, an Italian mariner, to explore new lands. Cabot sailed from England that year and made landfall somewhere along the North American coastline. For the next century, English fishermen routinely crossed the Atlantic to fish the rich waters off the North American coast. However, English colonization efforts in the 1500s were closer to home, as England devoted its energy to the colonization of Ireland.</p>

<p id="fs-idm51125232">Queen Elizabeth favored England&#8217;s advance into the Atlantic World, though her main concern was blocking Spain&#8217;s effort to eliminate Protestantism. Indeed, England could not commit to large-scale colonization in the Americas as long as Spain appeared ready to invade Ireland or Scotland. Nonetheless, Elizabeth approved of English <span data-type="term">privateers</span>, sea captains to whom the home government had given permission to raid the enemy at will. These skilled mariners cruised the Caribbean, plundering Spanish ships whenever they could. Each year the English took more than &#163;100,000 from Spain in this way; English privateer Francis Drake first made a name for himself when, in 1573, he looted silver, gold, and pearls worth &#163;40,000.</p>

<p id="fs-idm49424">Elizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in 1584, when Sir Walter Raleigh, a favorite of the queen&#8217;s, attempted to establish a colony at <span data-type="term">Roanoke</span>, an island off the coast of present-day North Carolina. The colony was small, consisting of only 117 people, who suffered a poor relationship with the local Indians, the Croatans, and struggled to survive in their new land (<a href="#CNX_History_02_03_Hariot" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Their governor, John White, returned to England in late 1587 to secure more people and supplies, but events conspired to keep him away from Roanoke for three years. By the time he returned in 1590, the entire colony had vanished. The only trace the colonists left behind was the word <em data-effect="italics">Croatoan</em> carved into a fence surrounding the village. Governor White never knew whether the colonists had decamped for nearby Croatoan Island (now Hatteras) or whether some disaster had befallen them all. Roanoke is still called &#8220;the lost colony.&#8221;</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_03_Hariot"><figcaption>In 1588, a promoter of English colonization named Thomas Hariot published <em data-effect="italics">A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia</em>, which contained many engravings of the native peoples who lived on the Carolina coast in the 1580s. This print, &#8220;The brovvyllinge of their fishe ouer the flame&#8221; (1590) by Theodor de Bry, shows the ingenuity and wisdom of the &#8220;savages&#8221; of the New World.

<p id="fs-idp10156048">English promoters of colonization pushed its commercial advantages and the religious justification that English colonies would allow the establishment of Protestantism in the Americas. Both arguments struck a chord. In the early 1600s, wealthy English merchants and the landed elite began to pool their resources to form <span data-type="term">joint stock companies</span>. In this novel business arrangement, which was in many ways the precursor to the modern corporation, investors provided the capital for and assumed the risk of a venture in order to reap significant returns. The companies gained the approval of the English crown to establish colonies, and their investors dreamed of reaping great profits from the money they put into overseas colonization.</p>

<p id="fs-idm13021840">The first permanent English settlement was established by a joint stock company, the Virginia Company. Named for Elizabeth, the &#8220;virgin queen,&#8221; the company gained royal approval to establish a colony on the east coast of North America, and in 1606, it sent 144 men and boys to the New World. In early 1607, this group sailed up Chesapeake Bay. Finding a river they called the James in honor of their new king, James I, they established a ramshackle settlement and named it Jamestown. Despite serious struggles, the colony survived.</p>

<p id="fs-idp16397632">Many of Jamestown&#8217;s settlers were desperate men; although they came from elite families, they were younger sons who would not inherit their father&#8217;s estates. The Jamestown adventurers believed they would find instant wealth in the New World and did not actually expect to have to perform work. Henry Percy, the eighth son of the Earl of Northumberland, was among them. His account, excerpted below, illustrates the hardships the English confronted in Virginia in 1607.</p>

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idp85850256" class="note history my-story" data-label="My Story"><div data-type="title" class="title">George Percy and the First Months at Jamestown</div>
<p id="fs-idp93983456">The 144 men and boys who started the Jamestown colony faced many hardships; by the end of the first winter, only 38 had survived. Disease, hunger, and poor relationships with local natives all contributed to the colony&#8217;s high death toll. George Percy, who served twice as governor of Jamestown, kept records of the colonists&#8217; first months in the colony. These records were later published in London in 1608. This excerpt is from his account of August and September of 1607.</p>

<p id="fs-idp32547056">
<blockquote id="fs-idp37492224">The fourth day of September died Thomas Jacob Sergeant. The fifth day, there died Benjamin Beast. Our men were destroyed with cruel diseases, as Swellings, Fluxes, Burning Fevers, and by wars, and some departed suddenly, but for the most part they died of mere famine. There were never Englishmen left in a foreign Country in such misery as we were in this new discovered Virginia. . . . Our food was but a small Can of Barley sod* in water, to five men a day, our drink cold water taken out of the River, which was at a flood very salty, at a low tide full of slime and filth, which was the destruction of many of our men. Thus we lived for the space of five months in this miserable distress, not having five able men to man our Bulwarks upon any occasion. If it had not pleased God to have put a terror in the Savages&#8217; hearts, we had all perished by those wild and cruel Pagans, being in that weak estate as we were; our men night and day groaning in every corner of the Fort most pitiful to hear. If there were any conscience in men, it would make their hearts to bleed to hear the pitiful murmurings and outcries of our sick men without relief, every night and day, for the space of six weeks, some departing out of the World, many times three or four in a night; in the morning, their bodies trailed out of their Cabins like Dogs to be buried. In this sort did I see the mortality of diverse of our people.</blockquote></p>
<p id="fs-idp31382064"><blockquote id="fs-idp3200048"><em data-effect="italics">*soaked</em></blockquote></p>

<p id="fs-idp27632576">According to George Percy&#8217;s account, what were the major problems the Jamestown settlers encountered? What kept the colony from complete destruction?</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idp87524800">By any measure, England came late to the race to colonize. As Jamestown limped along in the 1610s, the Spanish Empire extended around the globe and grew rich from its global colonial project. Yet the English persisted, and for this reason the Jamestown settlement has a special place in history as the first permanent colony in what later became the United States.</p>

<p id="fs-idp68631664">After Jamestown&#8217;s founding, English colonization of the New World accelerated. In 1609, a ship bound for Jamestown foundered in a storm and landed on Bermuda. (Some believe this incident helped inspire Shakespeare&#8217;s 1611 play <em data-effect="italics">The Tempest</em>.) The admiral of the ship, George Somers, claimed the island for the English crown. The English also began to colonize small islands in the Caribbean, an incursion into the Spanish American empire. They established themselves on small islands such as St. Christopher (1624), Barbados (1627), Nevis (1628), Montserrat (1632), and Antigua (1632).</p>

<p id="fs-idp64842672">From the start, the English West Indies had a commercial orientation, for these islands produced cash crops: first tobacco and then sugar. Very quickly, by the mid-1600s, Barbados had become one of the most important English colonies because of the sugar produced there. Barbados was the first English colony dependent on slaves, and it became a model for other English slave societies on the American mainland. These differed radically from England itself, where slavery was not practiced.</p>

<p id="fs-idp31677424">English Puritans also began to colonize the Americas in the 1620s and 1630s. These intensely religious migrants dreamed of creating communities of reformed Protestantism where the corruption of England would be eliminated. One of the first groups of Puritans to remove to North America, known as <span data-type="term">Pilgrims</span> and led by William Bradford, had originally left England to live in the Netherlands. Fearing their children were losing their English identity among the Dutch, however, they sailed for North America in 1620 to settle at Plymouth, the first English settlement in New England. The Pilgrims differed from other Puritans in their insistence on separating from what they saw as the corrupt Church of England. For this reason, Pilgrims are known as <span data-type="term">Separatists</span>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp60612128">Like Jamestown, Plymouth occupies an iconic place in American national memory. The tale of the 102 migrants who crossed the Atlantic aboard the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">Mayflower</em></span> and their struggle for survival is a well-known narrative of the founding of the country. Their story includes the signing of the Mayflower Compact, a written agreement whereby the English voluntarily agreed to help each other. Some interpret this 1620 document as an expression of democratic spirit because of the cooperative and inclusive nature of the agreement to live and work together. In 1630, a much larger contingent of Puritans left England to escape conformity to the Church of England and founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In the following years, thousands more arrived to create a new life in the rocky soils and cold climates of New England.</p>

<p id="fs-idm1598880">In comparison to Catholic Spain, however, Protestant England remained a very weak imperial player in the early seventeenth century, with only a few infant colonies in the Americas in the early 1600s. The English never found treasure equal to that of the Aztec city of Tenochtitl&#225;n, and England did not quickly grow rich from its small American outposts. The English colonies also differed from each other; Barbados and Virginia had a decidedly commercial orientation from the start, while the Puritan colonies of New England were intensely religious at their inception. All English settlements in America, however, marked the increasingly important role of England in the Atlantic World.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp1027232"><h1 data-type="title">FRENCH EXPLORATION</h1>
<p id="fs-idp5265120">Spanish exploits in the New World whetted the appetite of other would-be imperial powers, including France. Like Spain, France was a Catholic nation and committed to expanding Catholicism around the globe. In the early sixteenth century, it joined the race to explore the New World and exploit the resources of the Western Hemisphere. Navigator Jacques Cartier claimed northern North America for France, naming the area New France. From 1534 to 1541, he made three voyages of discovery on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the St. Lawrence River. Like other explorers, Cartier made exaggerated claims of mineral wealth in America, but he was unable to send great riches back to France. Due to resistance from the native peoples as well as his own lack of planning, he could not establish a permanent settlement in North America.</p>

<p id="fs-idm38393904">Explorer Samuel de Champlain occupies a special place in the history of the Atlantic World for his role in establishing the French presence in the New World. Champlain explored the Caribbean in 1601 and then the coast of New England in 1603 before traveling farther north. In 1608 he founded Quebec, and he made numerous Atlantic crossings as he worked tirelessly to promote New France. Unlike other imperial powers, France&#8212;through Champlain&#8217;s efforts&#8212;fostered especially good relationships with native peoples, paving the way for French exploration further into the continent: around the Great Lakes, around Hudson Bay, and eventually to the Mississippi. Champlain made an alliance with the Huron confederacy and the Algonquins and agreed to fight with them against their enemy, the Iroquois (<a href="#CNX_History_02_03_Champlain" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_03_Champlain"><figcaption>In this engraving, titled <em data-effect="italics">Defeat of the Iroquois</em> and based on a drawing by explorer Samuel de Champlain, Champlain is shown fighting on the side of the Huron and Algonquins against the Iroquois.

What does this engraving suggest about the impact of European exploration and settlement on the Americas?</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idp15237792">The French were primarily interested in establishing commercially viable colonial outposts, and to that end, they created extensive trading networks in New France. These networks relied on native hunters to harvest furs, especially beaver pelts, and to exchange these items for French glass beads and other trade goods. (French fashion at the time favored broad-brimmed hats trimmed in beaver fur, so French traders had a ready market for their North American goods.) The French also dreamed of replicating the wealth of Spain by colonizing the tropical zones. After Spanish control of the Caribbean began to weaken, the French turned their attention to small islands in the West Indies, and by 1635 they had colonized two, Guadeloupe and Martinique. Though it lagged far behind Spain, France now boasted its own West Indian colonies. Both islands became lucrative sugar plantation sites that turned a profit for French planters by relying on African slave labor.</p>

<p id="fs-idm47455504">Dutch entrance into the Atlantic World is part of the larger story of religious and imperial conflict in the early modern era. In the 1500s, Calvinism, one of the major Protestant reform movements, had found adherents in the northern provinces of the Spanish Netherlands. During the sixteenth century, these provinces began a long struggle to achieve independence from Catholic Spain. Established in 1581 but not recognized as independent by Spain until 1648, the Dutch Republic, or Holland, quickly made itself a powerful force in the race for Atlantic colonies and wealth. The Dutch distinguished themselves as commercial leaders in the seventeenth century (<a href="#CNX_History_02_03_Amsterdam" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and their mode of colonization relied on powerful corporations: the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1602 to trade in Asia, and the Dutch West India Company, established in 1621 to colonize and trade in the Americas.</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_03_Amsterdam"><figcaption>Amsterdam was the richest city in the world in the 1600s. In <em data-effect="italics">Courtyard of the Exchange in Amsterdam</em>, a 1653 painting by Emanuel de Witt, merchants involved in the global trade eagerly attend to news of shipping and the prices of commodities.</figcaption>

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm28580016">While employed by the Dutch East India Company in 1609, the English sea captain Henry Hudson explored New York Harbor and the river that now bears his name. Like many explorers of the time, Hudson was actually seeking a northwest passage to Asia and its wealth, but the ample furs harvested from the region he explored, especially the coveted beaver pelts, provided a reason to claim it for the Netherlands. The Dutch named their colony New Netherlands, and it served as a fur-trading outpost for the expanding and powerful Dutch West India Company. With headquarters in New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan, the Dutch set up several regional trading posts, including one at Fort Orange&#8212;named for the royal Dutch House of Orange-Nassau&#8212;in present-day Albany. (The color orange remains significant to the Dutch, having become particularly associated with William of Orange, Protestantism, and the Glorious Revolution of 1688.) A brisk trade in furs with local Algonquian and Iroquois peoples brought the Dutch and native peoples together in a commercial network that extended throughout the Hudson River Valley and beyond.</p>

<p id="fs-idm26968512">The Dutch West India Company in turn established colonies on Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura&#231;ao, St. Martin, St. Eustatius, and Saba. With their outposts in New Netherlands and the Caribbean, the Dutch had established themselves in the seventeenth century as a commercially powerful rival to Spain. Amsterdam became a trade hub for all the Atlantic World.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp362416" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idp2619344">By the beginning of the seventeenth century, Spain&#8217;s rivals&#8212;England, France, and the Dutch Republic&#8212;had each established an Atlantic presence, with greater or lesser success, in the race for imperial power. None of the new colonies, all in the eastern part of North America, could match the Spanish possessions for gold and silver resources. Nonetheless, their presence in the New World helped these nations establish claims that they hoped could halt the runaway growth of Spain&#8217;s Catholic empire. English colonists in Virginia suffered greatly, expecting riches to fall into their hands and finding reality a harsh blow. However, the colony at Jamestown survived, and the output of England&#8217;s islands in the West Indies soon grew to be an important source of income for the country. New France and New Netherlands were modest colonial holdings in the northeast of the continent, but these colonies&#8217; thriving fur trade with native peoples, and their alliances with those peoples, helped to create the foundation for later shifts in the global balance of power.</p>

<li>Describe the theory of mercantilism and the process of commodification</li>

</ul></div>
<p id="fs-idm66892016">European promoters of colonization claimed the Americas overflowed with a wealth of treasures. Burnishing national glory and honor became entwined with carving out colonies, and no nation wanted to be left behind. However, the realities of life in the Americas&#8212;violence, exploitation, and particularly the need for workers&#8212;were soon driving the practice of slavery and forced labor. Everywhere in America a stark contrast existed between freedom and slavery. The Columbian Exchange, in which Europeans transported plants, animals, and diseases across the Atlantic in both directions, also left a lasting impression on the Americas.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm31251360"><h1 data-type="title">LABOR SYSTEMS</h1>
<p id="fs-idp11219856">Physical power&#8212;to work the fields, build villages, process raw materials&#8212;is a necessity for maintaining a society. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, humans could derive power only from the wind, water, animals, or other humans. Everywhere in the Americas, a crushing demand for labor bedeviled Europeans because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going. Spain granted <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">encomiendas</em></span>&#8212;legal rights to native labor&#8212;to conquistadors who could prove their service to the crown. This system reflected the Spanish view of colonization: the king rewarded successful conquistadors who expanded the empire. Some native peoples who had sided with the conquistadors, like the Tlaxcalan, also gained <em data-effect="italics">encomiendas</em>; Malintzin, the Nahua woman who helped Cort&#233;s defeat the Mexica, was granted one.</p>

<p id="fs-idm35961056">The Spanish believed native peoples would work for them by right of conquest, and, in return, the Spanish would bring them Catholicism. In theory the relationship consisted of reciprocal obligations, but in practice the Spaniards ruthlessly exploited it, seeing native people as little more than beasts of burden. Convinced of their right to the land and its peoples, they sought both to control native labor and to impose what they viewed as correct religious beliefs upon the land&#8217;s inhabitants. Native peoples everywhere resisted both the labor obligations and the effort to change their ancient belief systems. Indeed, many retained their religion or incorporated only the parts of Catholicism that made sense to them.</p>

<p id="fs-idp37695520">The system of <em data-effect="italics">encomiendas</em> was accompanied by a great deal of violence (<a href="#CNX_History_02_04_Encomienda" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). One Spaniard, Bartolom&#233; de Las Casas , denounced the brutality of Spanish rule. A Dominican friar, Las Casas had been one of the earliest Spanish settlers in the Spanish West Indies. In his early life in the Americas, he owned Indian slaves and was the recipient of an <em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em>. However, after witnessing the savagery with which <em data-effect="italics">encomenderos</em> (recipients of <em data-effect="italics">encomiendas</em>) treated the native people, he reversed his views. In 1515, Las Casas released his native slaves, gave up his <em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em>, and began to advocate for humane treatment of native peoples. He lobbied for new legislation, eventually known as the New Laws, which would eliminate slavery and the <em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em> system.</p>

<p id="fs-idp24713680">Las Casas&#8217;s writing about the Spaniards&#8217; horrific treatment of Indians helped inspire the so-called <span data-type="term">Black Legend</span>, the idea that the Spanish were bloodthirsty conquerors with no regard for human life. Perhaps not surprisingly, those who held this view of the Spanish were Spain&#8217;s imperial rivals. English writers and others seized on the idea of Spain&#8217;s ruthlessness to support their own colonization projects. By demonizing the Spanish, they justified their own efforts as more humane. All European colonizers, however, shared a disregard for Indians.</p>

<p id="fs-idp67747216"><blockquote id="fs-idp19863088">Into and among these gentle sheep, endowed by their Maker and Creator with all the qualities aforesaid, did creep the Spaniards, who no sooner had knowledge of these people than they became like fierce wolves and tigers and lions who have gone many days without food or nourishment.

<p id="fs-idp53146576">How might these writings have been used to promote the &#8220;black legend&#8221; against Spain as well as subsequent English exploration and colonization?</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idm17006608">Indians were not the only source of cheap labor in the Americas; by the middle of the sixteenth century, Africans formed an important element of the labor landscape, producing the cash crops of sugar and tobacco for European markets. Europeans viewed Africans as non-Christians, which they used as a justification for enslavement. Denied control over their lives, slaves endured horrendous conditions. At every opportunity, they resisted enslavement, and their resistance was met with violence. Indeed, physical, mental, and sexual violence formed a key strategy among European slaveholders in their effort to assert mastery and impose their will. The Portuguese led the way in the evolving transport of slaves across the Atlantic; slave &#8220;factories&#8221; on the west coast of Africa, like Elmina Castle in Ghana, served as holding pens for slaves brought from Africa&#8217;s interior. In time, other European imperial powers would follow in the footsteps of the Portuguese by constructing similar outposts on the coast of West Africa.</p>

<p id="fs-idm29424800">The Portuguese traded or sold slaves to Spanish, Dutch, and English colonists in the Americas, particularly in South America and the Caribbean, where sugar was a primary export. Thousands of African slaves found themselves growing, harvesting, and processing <span data-type="term">sugarcane</span> in an arduous routine of physical labor. Slaves had to cut the long cane stalks by hand and then bring them to a mill, where the cane juice was extracted. They boiled the extracted cane juice down to a brown, crystalline sugar, which then had to be cured in special curing houses to have the molasses drained from it. The result was refined sugar, while the leftover molasses could be distilled into rum. Every step was labor-intensive and often dangerous.</p>

<p id="fs-idm9315152">Las Casas estimated that by 1550, there were fifty thousand slaves on Hispaniola. However, it is a mistake to assume that during the very early years of European exploration all Africans came to America as slaves; some were free men who took part in expeditions, for example, serving as conquistadors alongside Cort&#233;s in his assault on Tenochtitl&#225;n. Nonetheless, African slavery was one of the most tragic outcomes in the emerging Atlantic World.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm19349632"><h1 data-type="title">COMMERCE IN THE NEW WORLD</h1>
<p id="fs-idm43370640">The economic philosophy of <span data-type="term">mercantilism</span> shaped European perceptions of wealth from the 1500s to the late 1700s. Mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth, as measured in gold and silver bullion, existed in the world. In order to gain power, nations had to amass wealth by mining these precious raw materials from their colonial possessions. During the age of European exploration, nations employed conquest, colonization, and trade as ways to increase their share of the bounty of the New World. Mercantilists did not believe in free trade, arguing instead that the nation should control trade to create wealth. In this view, colonies existed to strengthen the colonizing nation. Mercantilists argued against allowing their nations to trade freely with other nations.</p>

<p id="fs-idp56912928">Spain&#8217;s mercantilist ideas guided its economic policy. Every year, slaves or native workers loaded shipments of gold and silver aboard Spanish treasure fleets that sailed from Cuba for Spain. These ships groaned under the sheer weight of bullion, for the Spanish had found huge caches of silver and gold in the New World. In South America, for example, Spaniards discovered rich veins of silver ore in the mountain called Potos&#237; and founded a settlement of the same name there. Throughout the sixteenth century, Potos&#237; was a boom town, attracting settlers from many nations as well as native people from many different cultures.</p>

<p id="fs-idm11617744">Colonial mercantilism, which was basically a set of protectionist policies designed to benefit the nation, relied on several factors: colonies rich in raw materials, cheap labor, colonial loyalty to the home government, and control of the shipping trade. Under this system, the colonies sent their raw materials, harvested by slaves or native workers, back to their mother country. The mother country sent back finished materials of all sorts: textiles, tools, clothing. The colonists could purchase these goods <em data-effect="italics">only</em> from their mother country; trade with other countries was forbidden.</p>

<p id="fs-idp3012496">The 1500s and early 1600s also introduced the process of <span data-type="term">commodification</span> to the New World. American silver, tobacco, and other items, which were used by native peoples for ritual purposes, became European commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold. Before the arrival of the Spanish, for example, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Inca</span> people of the Andes consumed <em data-effect="italics">chicha</em>, a corn beer, for ritual purposes only. When the Spanish discovered chicha, they bought and traded for it, turning it into a commodity instead of a ritual substance. Commodification thus recast native economies and spurred the process of early commercial capitalism. New World resources, from plants to animal pelts, held the promise of wealth for European imperial powers.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm17565536"><h1 data-type="title">THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE</h1>
<p id="fs-idm71438704">As Europeans traversed the Atlantic, they brought with them plants, animals, and diseases that changed lives and landscapes on both sides of the ocean. These two-way exchanges between the Americas and Europe/Africa are known collectively as the <span data-type="term">Columbian Exchange</span> (<a href="#CNX_History_02_04_Columbian" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_04_Columbian"><figcaption>With European exploration and settlement of the New World, goods and diseases began crossing the Atlantic Ocean in both directions. This &#8220;Columbian Exchange&#8221; soon had global implications.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm108743152">Of all the commodities in the Atlantic World, sugar proved to be the most important. Indeed, sugar carried the same economic importance as oil does today. European rivals raced to create sugar plantations in the Americas and fought wars for control of some of the best sugar production areas. Although refined sugar was available in the Old World, Europe&#8217;s harsher climate made sugarcane difficult to grow, and it was not plentiful. Columbus brought sugar to Hispaniola in 1493, and the new crop was growing there by the end of the 1490s. By the first decades of the 1500s, the Spanish were building sugar mills on the island. Over the next century of colonization, Caribbean islands and most other tropical areas became centers of sugar production.</p>

<p id="fs-idm64666960">Though of secondary importance to sugar, tobacco achieved great value for Europeans as a cash crop as well. Native peoples had been growing it for medicinal and ritual purposes for centuries before European contact, smoking it in pipes or powdering it to use as snuff. They believed tobacco could improve concentration and enhance wisdom. To some, its use meant achieving an entranced, altered, or divine state; entering a spiritual place.</p>

<p id="fs-idm37217744">Tobacco was unknown in Europe before 1492, and it carried a negative stigma at first. The early Spanish explorers considered natives&#8217; use of tobacco to be proof of their savagery and, because of the fire and smoke produced in the consumption of tobacco, evidence of the Devil&#8217;s sway in the New World. Gradually, however, European colonists became accustomed to and even took up the habit of smoking, and they brought it across the Atlantic. As did the Indians, Europeans ascribed medicinal properties to tobacco, claiming that it could cure headaches and skin irritations. Even so, Europeans did not import tobacco in great quantities until the 1590s. At that time, it became the first truly global commodity; English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese colonists all grew it for the world market.</p>

<p id="fs-idm71075664">Native peoples also introduced Europeans to chocolate, made from cacao seeds and used by the Aztec in Mesoamerica as currency. Mesoamerican Indians consumed unsweetened chocolate in a drink with chili peppers, vanilla, and a spice called achiote. This chocolate drink&#8212;<em data-effect="italics">xocolatl</em>&#8212;was part of ritual ceremonies like marriage and an everyday item for those who could afford it. Chocolate contains theobromine, a stimulant, which may be why native people believed it brought them closer to the sacred world.</p>

<p id="fs-idm54251504">Spaniards in the New World considered drinking chocolate a vile practice; one called chocolate &#8220;the Devil&#8217;s vomit.&#8221; In time, however, they introduced the beverage to Spain. At first, chocolate was available only in the Spanish court, where the elite mixed it with sugar and other spices. Later, as its availability spread, chocolate gained a reputation as a love potion.</p>

<p id="fs-idp31531216">The crossing of the Atlantic by plants like cacao and tobacco illustrates the ways in which the discovery of the New World changed the habits and behaviors of Europeans. Europeans changed the New World in turn, not least by bringing Old World animals to the Americas. On his second voyage, Christopher Columbus brought pigs, horses, cows, and chickens to the islands of the Caribbean. Later explorers followed suit, introducing new animals or reintroducing ones that had died out (like horses). With less vulnerability to disease, these animals often fared better than humans in their new home, thriving both in the wild and in domestication.</p>

<p id="fs-idm30832336">Europeans encountered New World animals as well. Because European Christians understood the world as a place of warfare between God and Satan, many believed the Americas, which lacked Christianity, were home to the Devil and his minions. The exotic, sometimes bizarre, appearances and habits of animals in the Americas that were previously unknown to Europeans, such as manatees, sloths, and poisonous snakes, confirmed this association. Over time, however, they began to rely more on observation of the natural world than solely on scripture. This shift&#8212;from seeing the Bible as the source of all received wisdom to trusting observation or empiricism&#8212;is one of the major outcomes of the era of early globalization.</p>

<p id="fs-idm14023088">Travelers between the Americas, Africa, and Europe also included microbes: silent, invisible life forms that had profound and devastating consequences. Native peoples had no immunity to diseases from across the Atlantic, to which they had never been exposed. European explorers unwittingly brought with them chickenpox, measles, mumps, and <span data-type="term">smallpox</span>, which ravaged native peoples despite their attempts to treat the diseases, decimating some populations and wholly destroying others (<a href="#CNX_History_02_04_Smallpox" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="CNX_History_02_04_Smallpox"><figcaption>This sixteenth-century Aztec drawing shows the suffering of a typical victim of smallpox. Smallpox and other contagious diseases brought by European explorers decimated Indian populations in the Americas.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm7565472" data-alt="A drawing shows five depictions of an Aztec smallpox victim. The victim, who is covered with spots, is shown sleeping, vomiting, and being examined by a healer.">

<p id="fs-idm49004928">In eastern North America, some native peoples interpreted death from disease as a hostile act. Some groups, including the Iroquois, engaged in raids or &#8220;<span data-type="term">mourning wars</span>,&#8221; taking enemy prisoners in order to assuage their grief and replace the departed. In a special ritual, the prisoners were &#8220;requickened&#8221;&#8212;assigned the identity of a dead person&#8212;and adopted by the bereaved family to take the place of their dead. As the toll from disease rose, mourning wars intensified and expanded.</p>

<p id="fs-idp6423904">In the minds of European rulers, colonies existed to create wealth for imperial powers. Guided by mercantilist ideas, European rulers and investors hoped to enrich their own nations and themselves, in order to gain the greatest share of what was believed to be a limited amount of wealth. In their own individual quest for riches and preeminence, European colonizers who traveled to the Americas blazed new and disturbing paths, such as the <em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em> system of forced labor and the use of tens of thousands of Africans as slaves.</p>
<p id="fs-idm49284704">All native inhabitants of the Americas who came into contact with Europeans found their worlds turned upside down as the new arrivals introduced their religions and ideas about property and goods. Europeans gained new foods, plants, and animals in the Columbian Exchange, turning whatever they could into a commodity to be bought and sold, and Indians were introduced to diseases that nearly destroyed them. At every turn, however, Indians placed limits on European colonization and resisted the newcomers&#8217; ways.</p>

<p id="fs-idp171917904">When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p id="fs-idm2128000">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. &#8212;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, &#8212;That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. &#8212;Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

<p id="fs-idp288181504">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p id="fs-idp14245168">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11147424">He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p id="fs-idm157826400">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p id="fs-idm78078144">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>

<p id="fs-idm25928928">He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>

<p id="fs-idp173491472">He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>

<p id="fs-idp317105200">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</p>

<p id="fs-idp233513904">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p id="fs-idp334394992">He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>

<p id="fs-idp239974688">He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>

<p id="fs-idm23824464">He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p>

<p id="fs-idm28254048">He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>

<p id="fs-idp142223840">For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p id="fs-idm61713760">For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>

<p id="fs-idp103005376">For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p id="fs-idm154731600">For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>

<p id="fs-idp32074704">For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>

<p id="fs-idm249216848">For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>

<p id="fs-idm168087056">For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p>

<p id="fs-idm201915008">For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>

<p id="fs-idm247900976">For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p id="fs-idm455824560">He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p>

<p id="fs-idm453773152">He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p id="fs-idm247617200">He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p id="fs-idm410585712">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>

<p id="fs-idp43044464">He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>

<p id="fs-idm44399024">In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p id="fs-idp84412976">Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>

<p id="fs-idm106699888">We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
