    </section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164197739219"><h1 data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164221149313">Biology meets the scope and sequence of a typical two semester biology course for biology majors, pre-med majors, and science majors. In developing <em data-effect="italics">Biology</em>, we listened to hundreds of General Biology instructors who readily provided feedback about their courses, students, challenges, and hopes for innovation. The expense of textbooks and related items did prove to be a barrier to learning.  But more importantly, these teachers suggested improvements for the textbook, which would ultimately lead to more meaningful and memorable learning experiences for students.  </p>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164201876325">The result is a book that addresses a core organizational reality of the course and its materials &#8211; the sheer breadth of the topical coverage.  We provide a thorough treatment of biology&#8217;s foundational concepts while condensing selected topics in response to the market&#8217;s request for a textbook with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike. We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways.  </p>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164185871638">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with the feedback of another one hundred reviewers, who thoroughly read the material and offered detailed critical commentary. </p>

</figure><p id="fs-id2299671">What is biology? In simple terms, <span data-type="term">biology</span> is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments. This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast. Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Listening to the daily news, you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology are discussed every day. For example, recent news topics include <em data-effect="italics">Escherichia coli</em> (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) outbreaks in spinach and <em data-effect="italics">Salmonella</em> contamination in peanut butter. Other subjects include efforts toward finding a cure for AIDS, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and cancer. On a global scale, many researchers are committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues, and reduce the effects of climate change. All of these diverse endeavors are related to different facets of the discipline of biology.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_01_02"><figcaption><em data-effect="italics">Escherichia coli</em> (<em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>) bacteria, seen in this scanning electron micrograph, are normal residents of our digestive tracts that aid in the absorption of vitamin K and other nutrients.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id932855"><h1 data-type="title">The Process of Science</h1>
<p id="fs-id2739621">Biology is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines? <span data-type="term">Science</span> (from the Latin <em data-effect="italics">scientia</em>, meaning &#8220;knowledge&#8221;) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method. It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science. The <span data-type="term">scientific method</span> is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.</p>
<p id="fs-id1787324">The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. A <span data-type="term">hypothesis</span> is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Although using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like archaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as it becomes more difficult to repeat experiments.</p>
<p id="fs-id2186987">These areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archeology&#8212;even though one cannot perform repeatable experiments, hypotheses may still be supported. For instance, an archeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed based on finding a piece of pottery. Further hypotheses could be made about various characteristics of this culture, and these hypotheses may be found to be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified theory. A <span data-type="term">theory</span> is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1876646"><h2 data-type="title">Natural Sciences</h2>
<p id="fs-id1626542">What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or, maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered <span data-type="term">natural sciences</span>. Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_01_03"><figcaption>The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and many other fields.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-id1879663">There is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. For some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into <span data-type="term">life sciences</span>, which study living things and include biology, and <span data-type="term">physical sciences</span>, which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Natural sciences are sometimes referred to as &#8220;hard science&#8221; because they rely on the use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive investigations and findings.</p>
<p id="fs-id1780952">Not surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell structure and function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism. Those biologists studying physiology, however, focus on the internal functioning of an organism. Some areas of biology focus on only particular types of living things. For example, botanists explore plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1470518"><h2 data-type="title">Scientific Reasoning</h2>
<p id="fs-id1422041">One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal &#8220;to know.&#8221; Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. To do this, they use two methods of logical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.</p>
<p id="fs-id1727981"><span data-type="term">Inductive reasoning</span> is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them. These data can be qualitative or quantitative, and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies provide an example. In this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing a specific activity, such as viewing images of food. The part of the brain that &#8220;lights up&#8221; during this activity is then predicted to be the part controlling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. The &#8220;lighting up&#8221; of the various areas of the brain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain. The resultant increase in radioactivity is observed by a scanner. Then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.</p>
<p id="fs-id2979121">Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reason, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. <span data-type="term">Deductive reasoning</span> is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. Studies in climate change can illustrate this type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a particular region, then the distribution of plants and animals should change. These predictions have been made and tested, and many such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture, with change based on temperature averages.</p>
<p id="fs-id1786661">Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based science. <span data-type="term">Descriptive (or discovery) science</span>, which is usually inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while <span data-type="term">hypothesis-based science</span>, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to specific questions. For example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dog&#8217;s fur had a tiny hook structure. On closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs&#8217; gripping device was more reliable than a zipper. He eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener popularly known today as Velcro. Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.</p>

</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2318184"><h1 data-type="title">The Scientific Method</h1>
<p id="fs-id1870503">Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England&#8217;s Sir Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626) (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost all fields of study as a logical, rational problem-solving method.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_01_04"><figcaption>Sir Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626) is credited with being the first to define the scientific method. (credit: Paul van Somer)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2569068" data-alt="Painting depicts Sir Francis Bacon in a long robe.">
<img src="/resources/8ef92f8bfbdda77c876312e09717875709a35fcc/Figure_01_01_04.jpg" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="Painting depicts Sir Francis Bacon in a long robe." width="200"/>
</span>

</figure><p id="fs-id1695658">The scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question. Let&#8217;s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: &#8220;Why is the classroom so warm?&#8221;</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1568706"><h2 data-type="title">Proposing a Hypothesis</h2>
<p id="fs-id1812636">Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, &#8220;The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.&#8221; But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be proposed. A second hypothesis might be, &#8220;The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-id1966007">Once a hypothesis has been selected, the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has the format &#8220;If . . . then . . . .&#8221; For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, &#8220;<em data-effect="italics">If</em> the student turns on the air conditioning, <em data-effect="italics">then</em> the classroom will no longer be too warm.&#8221;</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2186799"><h2 data-type="title">Testing a Hypothesis</h2>
<p id="fs-id1428118">A valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also be <span data-type="term">falsifiable</span>, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results. Importantly, science does not claim to &#8220;prove&#8221; anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information. This step&#8212;openness to disproving ideas&#8212;is what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. The presence of the supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. A <span data-type="term">variable</span> is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. The <span data-type="term">control group</span> contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about. Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow. To test the first hypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should be rejected. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check if the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and this hypothesis should be rejected. Each hypothesis should be tested by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data are rejected.</p><p id="fs-id2000920">While this &#8220;warm classroom&#8221; example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer controls. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. One observation to explain this occurrence might be, &#8220;When I eat breakfast before class, I am better able to pay attention.&#8221; The student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p id="fs-id1473946">In hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted from a general premise. This type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. But the reverse of the process is also possible: sometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations. This type of reasoning is called inductive reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general. Inductive and deductive reasoning are often used in tandem to advance scientific knowledge (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

</div><p id="fs-id1386450">The scientific method may seem too rigid and structured. It is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often follow this sequence, there is flexibility. Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests. Notice, too, that the scientific method can be applied to solving problems that aren&#8217;t necessarily scientific in nature.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2984399"><h1 data-type="title">Two Types of Science: Basic Science and Applied Science</h1>
<p id="fs-id1983427">The scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. Is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic science and applied science.</p>
<p id="fs-id1980540"><span data-type="term">Basic science</span> or &#8220;pure&#8221; science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge&#8217;s sake, though this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application.</p>
<p id="fs-id2164078">In contrast, <span data-type="term">applied science</span> or &#8220;technology,&#8221; aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_01_07"><figcaption>After Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rescued this brown pelican. Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how to rehabilitate the bird. (credit: FEMA)</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-id2317257" data-alt="A photo shows a rescue worker holding a brown pelican with a broken wing wrapped in a red cast.">

</span>

</figure>
<p id="fs-id3662284">Some individuals may perceive applied science as &#8220;useful&#8221; and basic science as &#8220;useless.&#8221; A question these people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, &#8220;What for?&#8221; A careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the wide knowledge foundation generated through basic science.</p>
<p id="fs-id1803917">One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, DNA makes new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity. Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.</p>
<p id="fs-id2690084">Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual&#8217;s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) Other less complex organisms have also been studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) relied on basic research carried out with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_01_08"><figcaption>The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different fields of science. The project, which sequenced the entire human genome, was completed in 2003.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-id3241178">While research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note that some discoveries are made by <span data-type="term">serendipity</span>, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Penicillin was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of <em data-effect="italics">Staphylococcus</em> bacteria open. An unwanted mold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out to be <em data-effect="italics">Penicillium</em>, and a new antibiotic was discovered. Even in the highly organized world of science, luck&#8212;when combined with an observant, curious mind&#8212;can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1467930"><h1 data-type="title">Reporting Scientific Work</h1>
<p id="fs-id3019610">Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists&#8212;when planning, conducting, and analyzing results&#8212;are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist&#8217;s work are communicating with peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. <span data-type="term">Peer-reviewed manuscripts</span> are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist&#8217;s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist&#8217;s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.</p>
<p id="fs-id2979084">A scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed guidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate. A scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.</p>
<p id="fs-id2954730">The scientific paper consists of several specific sections&#8212;introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. This structure is sometimes called the &#8220;IMRaD&#8221; format. There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an <span data-type="term">abstract</span> (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published; for example, some review papers require an outline.</p>
<p id="fs-id1292278">The <span data-type="term">introduction</span> starts with brief, but broad, background information about what is known in the field. A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented. The introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal. Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered <span data-type="term">plagiarism</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id2279649">The <span data-type="term">materials and methods</span> section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used, and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data. The description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose. This section will also include information on how measurements were made and what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to examine raw data. Although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not discuss them.</p>
<p id="fs-id1790931">Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both. If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections, the <span data-type="term">results</span> section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation. The results are presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should be presented. In the <span data-type="term">discussion</span> section, the researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to explain the observations. It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research. Therefore, proper citations are included in this section as well.</p>
<p id="fs-id2967146">Finally, the <span data-type="term">conclusion</span> section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions. Therefore, a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others to continue and expand on the findings.</p>
<p id="fs-id1318474"><span data-type="term">Review articles</span> do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature; instead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive reference sections.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2433529" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-id2261646">Biology is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments. Science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe in whole or in part by rational means. Science has many fields; those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena are considered natural sciences.</p>
<p id="fs-id1836512">Science can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic science is to expand knowledge without any expectation of short-term practical application of that knowledge. The primary goal of applied research, however, is to solve practical problems.</p>
<p id="fs-id2909561">Two types of logical reasoning are used in science. Inductive reasoning uses particular results to produce general scientific principles. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts results by applying general principles. The common thread throughout scientific research is the use of the scientific method, a step-based process that consists of making observations, defining a problem, posing hypotheses, testing these hypotheses, and drawing one or more conclusions. The testing uses proper controls. Scientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals. A scientific research paper consists of several well-defined sections: introduction, materials and methods, results, and, finally, a concluding discussion. Review papers summarize the research done in a particular field over a period of time.</p>

<p id="fs-id1808646">Biology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p id="fs-id2248548">From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something &#8220;alive&#8221;? And once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? And, finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1396394"><h1 data-type="title">Properties of Life</h1>
<p id="fs-id2137494">All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these nine characteristics serve to define life.</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2008387"><h2 data-type="title">Order</h2>

</span>
    </figure><p id="fs-id1477381">Organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and other cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.</p>

For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or respond to touch (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called <em data-effect="italics">chemotaxis</em>) or light (<em data-effect="italics">phototaxis</em>).

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1794075"><h2 data-type="title">Reproduction</h2>
<p id="fs-id1397107">Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, genes containing DNA are passed along to an organism&#8217;s offspring. These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.</p>

<p id="fs-id1962069">Organisms grow and develop following specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide instructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species&#8217; young (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_03"><figcaption>Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1470518"><h2 data-type="title">Regulation</h2>
<p id="fs-id2195734">Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions, respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.</p>

    </figure><p id="fs-id2853902">In order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through <span data-type="term">homeostasis</span> (literally, &#8220;steady state&#8221;)&#8212;the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.</p>

<p id="fs-id1850530">Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large. The <span data-type="term">atom</span> is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A <span data-type="term">molecule</span> is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds. Many molecules that are biologically important are <span data-type="term">macromolecules</span>, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.</p>

</div><p id="fs-id2074834">Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called <span data-type="term">organelles</span>. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells; the <span data-type="term">cell</span> itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <span data-type="term">Prokaryotes</span> are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of <span data-type="term">eukaryotes</span> do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.</p>
<p id="fs-id2155753">In larger organisms, cells combine to make <span data-type="term">tissues</span>, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions. <span data-type="term">Organs</span> are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An <span data-type="term">organ system</span> is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have many organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. <span data-type="term">Organisms</span> are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.</p>
<p id="eip-622">All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a <span data-type="term">population</span>. For example, a forest may include many pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A <span data-type="term">community</span> is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest&#8217;s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An <span data-type="term">ecosystem</span> consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water. At the highest level of organization (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), the <span data-type="term">biosphere</span> is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth.

The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_02_08"><figcaption>This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using data obtained from sequencing ribosomal RNA genes.

    <p id="fs-id2024686"><span data-type="title">Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree</span>In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains&#8212;Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding bacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).</p>
    <p id="fs-id2956594">Woese&#8217;s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese&#8217;s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_09" data-orient="vertical"><figcaption>These images represent different domains.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1998058"><h1 data-type="title">Branches of Biological Study</h1>
<p id="fs-id1908444">The scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines. Biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, <span data-type="term">molecular biology</span> and <span data-type="term">biochemistry</span> study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way they are regulated. <span data-type="term">Microbiology</span>, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled organisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and geneticists, among others.</p>

Biologists as well as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_10"><figcaption>This forensic scientist works in a DNA extraction room at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory at Fort Gillem, GA.

Because of its interdisciplinary nature, this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches.</p>

<p id="fs-id2117424">Biology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today. Excitingly, it is the cradle of emerging sciences, such as the biology of brain activity, genetic engineering of custom organisms, and the biology of evolution that uses the laboratory tools of molecular biology to retrace the earliest stages of life on earth. A scan of news headlines&#8212;whether reporting on immunizations, a newly discovered species, sports doping, or a genetically-modified food&#8212;demonstrates the way biology is active in and important to our everyday world.</p>

<p id="fs-idp250733232">Elements in various combinations comprise all matter, including living things. Some of the most abundant elements in living organisms include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These form the nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids that are the fundamental components of living matter. Biologists must understand these important building blocks and the unique structures of the atoms that make up molecules, allowing for the formation of cells, tissues, organ systems, and entire organisms.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10142720">All biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry, so in order to understand how biological systems work, it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry. For example, the flow of blood within the circulatory system follows the laws of physics that regulate the modes of fluid flow. The breakdown of the large, complex molecules of food into smaller molecules&#8212;and the conversion of these to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8212;is a series of chemical reactions that follow chemical laws. The properties of water and the formation of hydrogen bonds are key to understanding living processes. Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important, for example, to our understanding of the digestive process. Therefore, the fundamentals of physics and chemistry are important for gaining insight into biological processes.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338804205648">At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. <span data-type="term">Matter</span> is any substance that occupies space and has mass. <span data-type="term">Elements</span> are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions. There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. The remaining elements are synthesized in laboratories and are unstable.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338796754528">Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already &#8220;taken&#8221; by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium.

For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth&#8217;s crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon.

<p id="fs-idp140338798858736">To understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element, the atom. An <span data-type="term">atom</span> is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities. Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338804724160">An atom is composed of two regions: the <span data-type="term">nucleus</span>, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.</p>
    <figure id="fig-ch02_01_01" class=" "><figcaption>Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140338808766608" data-alt="This illustration shows that, like planets orbiting the sun, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom.

        </span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp140338797859808">Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 &#215; 10<sup>-24</sup> grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in <a href="#tab-ch02_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge. A <span data-type="term">proton</span> is positively charged whereas a <span data-type="term">neutron</span> is uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. <span data-type="term">Electrons</span> are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 &#215; 10<sup>-28</sup> grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element&#8217;s overall atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom&#8217;s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom&#8217;s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338796885040">Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom&#8212;greater than 99 percent&#8212;is, in fact, empty space. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338804903648">Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an element&#8217;s <span data-type="term">atomic number</span> and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element&#8217;s <span data-type="term">mass number</span>, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an element&#8217;s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the <span data-type="term">atomic mass</span>, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).</p>

<p id="eip-idm257115376"><span data-type="title">Carbon Dating</span>
Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric <sup>14</sup>N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays. This is a continuous process, so more <sup>14</sup>C is always being created. As a living organism incorporates <sup>14</sup>C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of <sup>14</sup>C in its body is equal to the concentration of <sup>14</sup>C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting <sup>14</sup>C, so the ratio between <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C will decline as <sup>14</sup>C decays gradually to <sup>14</sup>N by a process called beta decay&#8212;the emission of electrons or positrons. This decay gives off energy in a slow process.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338807733920">After approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of <sup>14</sup>C will have been converted back to <sup>14</sup>N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life. Because the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood. Comparing the ratio of the <sup>14</sup>C concentration found in an object to the amount of <sup>14</sup>C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. On the basis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes with different half lives. For example, <sup>40</sup>K (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and <sup>235</sup>U (Uranium 235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. Through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from earlier species.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140338796725872"><h1 data-type="title">Electron Shells and the Bohr Model</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140338796303120">It should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons equal to its atomic number.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338797198608">An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885&#8211;1962). The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular <span data-type="term">orbitals</span> at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol &#8220;n.&#8221; For example, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_05" class=" "><figcaption>The Bohr model was developed by Niels Bohrs in 1913. In this model, electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, a photon of light is released.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140338797513600" data-alt="Three concentric circles around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom represent principal shells.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp140338797044128">Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338797044384">Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons. This is known as the <span data-type="term">octet rule</span>, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their <span data-type="term">valence shell</span>, the outermost electron shell. Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Notice that in this <a href="#fig-ch02_01_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, helium has a complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell. Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons. In contrast, chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but theoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.</p>

</div><p id="fs-idp140338806026832">Understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located. Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the table&#8217;s far right column in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms. Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the <span data-type="term">inert gases</span> (or <span data-type="term">noble gases</span>). Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged <span data-type="term">ions</span>. Group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus, the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements&#8217; outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338796317104">Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but are found in <span data-type="term">electron orbitals</span>. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. The area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital.</p>
        <p id="fs-idp140338796636704">Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom&#8217;s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the letter s,<em data-effect="italics"> p</em>,<em data-effect="italics"> d</em>, and<em data-effect="italics"> f</em>. The <em data-effect="italics">s</em> subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital, which can hold two electrons.

Subshells <em data-effect="italics">d</em> and <em data-effect="italics">f</em> have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. These are not shown in the illustration.

The 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled.

This is designated as 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em><sup>1</sup>, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital.

<p id="fs-idp140338796548544">All elements are most stable when their outermost shell is filled with electrons according to the octet rule.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140338797093616"><h1 data-type="title">Ions and Ionic Bonds</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140338806167168">Some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. <span data-type="term">Cations</span> are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions. <span data-type="term">Anions</span> are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in &#8220;-ide&#8221;: the anion of chlorine is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338806078224"> This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as <span data-type="term">electron transfer</span>. As <a href="#fig-ch02_01_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates, sodium (Na)  only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (&#8211;1) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or &#8211;1 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140338805329568"><h1 data-type="title">Covalent Bonds and Other Bonds and Interactions</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140338803668752">Another way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form <span data-type="term">covalent bonds</span>. These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds are also found in inorganic molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.</p><p id="fs-idp140338805937584">The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338804795680">The formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms. To completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.</p>

<p id="fs-idp140338802227312">There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a <span data-type="term">polar covalent bond</span>, shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (<em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em>+) or slightly negative (<em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em>&#8211;) charge develops. This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.</p><p id="fs-idp140338804492768">Water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen&#8217;s electrons. Thus oxygen has a higher <span data-type="term">electronegativity</span> than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus. Either way, the atom&#8217;s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often present in organic molecules.</p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp140338799671424"><h2 data-type="title">Nonpolar Covalent Bonds</h2>
<p id="fs-idp140338799846288"><span data-type="term">Nonpolar covalent bonds</span> form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally. For example, molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338804490560">Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), also shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_11" class=" "><figcaption>Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140338805989184" data-alt="Table compares water, methane and carbon dioxide molecules. In water, oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than hydrogen resulting in a polar covalent O-H bond. Likewise in carbon dioxide the oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than carbon and the bond is polar covalent. However, water has a bent shape because two lone pairs of electrons push the hydrogen atoms together so the molecule is polar. By contrast carbon dioxide has two double bonds that repel each other, resulting in a linear shape. The polar bonds in carbon dioxide cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule. In methane, the bond between carbon and hydrogen is nonpolar and the molecule is a symmetrical tetrahedron with hydrogens spaced as far apart as possible on the three-dimensional sphere. Since methane is symmetrical with nonpolar bonds, it is a nonpolar molecule.">

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp140338797683184"><h2 data-type="title">Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions</h2><p id="fs-idp140338797683824">Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break.  Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.</p><p id="fs-idp140338806173648">When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen&#8217;s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the <em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em><sup>+</sup>of the hydrogen from one molecule and the <em data-effect="italics">&#948;</em>&#8211; charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a <span data-type="term">hydrogen bond</span>. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.</p><p id="fs-idp140338806175616">Like hydrogen bonds, <span data-type="term">van der Waals interactions</span> are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities, which are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one another. These bonds&#8212;along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds&#8212;contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-idp140338804794304" class="note career" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Career Connection</div>
<p id="eip-idp66537328"><span data-type="title">Pharmaceutical Chemist</span>
Pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and new drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process. Drugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory. In many cases, potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338805878000">After the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production. Then, the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins. In the United States, drug approval is handled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat. This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to chemists, to complete testing and gain approval.</p><p id="fs-idp140338804755008">An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel (Taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat breast cancer. This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. Another example is aspirin, originally isolated from willow tree bark. Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them. Sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found. For example, the use of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt. It was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified and marketed for human use.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140338806211664">Occasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to be used in other, unrelated ways. For example, the drug minoxidil (Rogaine) was originally developed to treat high blood pressure. When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair. Eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair.</p>
        <p id="fs-idp140338804755392">The career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug development, all with the goal of making human beings healthier.</p>

It is made up of elements. All of the 92 elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. Electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions.</p>

<p id="fs-idp17500704">Why do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? Why is water so important? It is because water is essential to life as we know it. Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth. Approximately 60&#8211;70 percent of the human body is made up of water. Without it, life as we know it simply would not exist.</p><p id="fs-idm208251152">The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life. Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an organism&#8217;s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell&#8217;s cytoplasm. Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH. Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm174636784"><h1 data-type="title">Water&#8217;s Polarity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm7526976">One of water&#8217;s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O) form polar covalent bonds. While there is no net charge to a water molecule, the polarity of water creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water&#8217;s properties of attraction. Water&#8217;s charges are generated because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that a shared electron would be found near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative charge near the oxygen.</p>
<p id="fs-idm211026512">As a result of water&#8217;s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as <span data-type="term">hydrophilic</span> (hydro- = &#8220;water&#8221;; -philic = &#8220;loving&#8221;). In contrast, non-polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and separate from it rather than dissolve in it, as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar (an acidic water solution). These nonpolar compounds are called <span data-type="term">hydrophobic</span> (hydro- = &#8220;water&#8221;; -phobic = &#8220;fearing&#8221;).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_02_01" class=" "><figcaption>Oil and water do not mix. As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but forms droplets instead.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp77990976"><h1 data-type="title">Water&#8217;s States: Gas, Liquid, and Solid</h1>
<p id="fs-idm194704288">The formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. As water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. The breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system. When the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). On the other hand, when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids.</p>
<p id="fs-idm243938000">Water&#8217;s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds are oriented as it freezes: the water molecules are pushed farther apart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes the lowering of kinetic energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density than the liquid.</p>
<p id="fs-idm201091888">The lower density of ice, illustrated and pictured in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, an anomaly, causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg or in the ice cubes in a glass of ice water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the surface of the water creating an insulating barrier that protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this layer of insulating ice, plants and animals living in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water. The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells, irreversibly damaging them. Cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm169208880"><h1 data-type="title">Water&#8217;s High Heat Capacity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm191066784">Water&#8217;s high heat capacity is a property caused by hydrogen bonding among water molecules. Water has the highest <span data-type="term">specific heat capacity</span> of any liquids. Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius. For water, this amount is one <span data-type="term">calorie</span>. It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool. In fact, the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand. This explains why the land cools faster than the sea. Due to its high heat capacity, water is used by warm blooded animals to more evenly disperse heat in their bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a car&#8217;s cooling system, transporting heat from warm places to cool places, causing the body to maintain a more even temperature.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm191438880"><h1 data-type="title">Water&#8217;s Heat of Vaporization</h1>
<p id="fs-idm126450912">Water also has a high <span data-type="term">heat of vaporization</span>, the amount of energy required to change one  gram of a liquid substance to a gas. A considerable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water. This process occurs on the surface of water. As liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules from each other, which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam). As a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol (grain alcohol), whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol molecules is weaker than water&#8217;s hydrogen bonding. Eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100&#176; Celsius (212&#176; Fahrenheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas. Even when below its boiling point, water&#8217;s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize: this process is known as <span data-type="term">evaporation</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm128609856">The fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that a substantial amount of energy is used in the process. As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is taking place. In many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm109112880"><h1 data-type="title">Water&#8217;s Solvent Properties</h1>
<p id="fs-idm146772512">Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. Therefore, water is referred to as a <span data-type="term">solvent</span>, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules. This is referred to as a <span data-type="term">sphere of hydration</span>, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water.</p><p id="fs-idm1321152">When ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of <span data-type="term">dissociation</span>. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when NaCl crystals are added to water, the molecules of NaCl dissociate into Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211; </sup> ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule&#8217;s oxygen. The negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm216592448"><h1 data-type="title">Water&#8217;s Cohesive and Adhesive Properties</h1>
<p id="fs-idm141033600">Have you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of <span data-type="term">cohesion</span>. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.</p>
<p id="fs-idm90917008">Cohesion allows for the development of <span data-type="term">surface tension</span>, the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress. This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity. When a small scrap of paper is placed onto the droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bonds of water molecules intact and support the item floating on the top. It&#8217;s even possible to &#8220;float&#8221; a needle on top of a glass of water if it is placed gently without breaking the surface tension, as shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_02_04" class=" "><figcaption>The weight of the needle is pulling the surface downward; at the same time, the surface tension is pulling it up, suspending it on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking.

</figure><p id="fs-idm30338832">These cohesive forces are related to water&#8217;s property of <span data-type="term">adhesion</span>, or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules. This attraction is sometimes stronger than water&#8217;s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. Adhesion is observed when water &#8220;climbs&#8221; up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it. This type of adhesion is called <span data-type="term">capillary action</span>, and is illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

    </figure><p id="fs-idm120562544">Why are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life? Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of water from the roots to the leaves in plants. These forces create a &#8220;pull&#8221; on the water column. This pull results from the tendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them, and so they are pulled along. Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves. Without these properties of water, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require. In another example, insects such as the water strider, shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on the surface layer of water and even mate there.</p>

You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, the pH test measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a given solution.</p><p id="fs-idm31045520">Hydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) ions and hydroxide (OH<sup>-</sup>) ions. While the hydroxide ions are kept in solution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, are immediately attracted to un-ionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>+</sup>). Still, by convention, scientists refer to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water.</p>
<p id="fs-idm76868480">The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup> moles H<sup>+</sup> ions per liter of water. Moles (mol) are a way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc), with one mole being equal to 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> particles of the substance. Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> water molecules. The pH is calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. The log10 of 1 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup> is -7.0, and the negative of this number (indicated by the &#8220;p&#8221; of &#8220;pH&#8221;) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also known as neutral pH. The pH inside of human cells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained.</p><p id="fs-idm13164960">Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. An <span data-type="term">acid</span> is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate. A <span data-type="term">base</span> provides either hydroxide ions (OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.</p>
<p id="fs-idm115769952">The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H<sup>+</sup>. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic, whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and are considered weak acids. Conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH<sup>&#8211; </sup>or take up hydrogen ions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH<sup>&#8211;</sup> rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH. An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0, close enough to neutral pH that marine organisms adapted to this saline environment are able to thrive in it.</p>
<p id="fs-idm38477696">The <span data-type="term">pH scale</span> is, as previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (<a href="#fig-ch02_02_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. Extremes in pH in either direction from 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life. The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral. However, the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2. So how do the cells of the stomach survive in such an acidic environment? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them? The answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying. New stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead ones, which are digested by the stomach acids. It is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced every seven to ten days.</p>

</div><p id="fs-idm174849296">So how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances (a human drinking orange juice, for example) and survive? Buffers are the key. <span data-type="term">Buffers</span> readily absorb excess H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person&#8217;s well-being. The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, hydrogen ions are removed, moderating pH changes. Similarly, as shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs. This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood&#8217;s pH. Likewise, if too much OH<sup>&#8211;</sup> is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH. Without this buffer system, the body&#8217;s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy.</p>
    <figure id="fig-ch02_02_08" class=" "><figcaption>This diagram shows the body&#8217;s buffering of blood pH levels. The blue arrows show the process of raising pH as more CO<sub>2</sub> is made.

</figure><p id="fs-idm246382528">Other examples of buffers are antacids used to combat excess stomach acid. Many of these over-the-counter medications work in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating pH, bringing relief to those that suffer &#8220;heartburn&#8221; after eating. The unique properties of water that contribute to this capacity to balance pH&#8212;as well as water&#8217;s other characteristics&#8212;are essential to sustaining life on Earth.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm241074512" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Section Summary</h1><p id="fs-idm207888432">Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is a polar molecule, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the water to have a high heat capacity, meaning it takes a lot of added heat to raise its temperature. As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and form anew. This allows for the overall temperature to remain stable, although energy is added to the system. Water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization, which is key to how organisms cool themselves by the evaporation of sweat. Water&#8217;s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension, whereas its adhesive properties are seen as water rises inside capillary tubes. The pH value is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is one of many chemical characteristics that is highly regulated in living organisms through homeostasis. Acids and bases can change pH values, but buffers tend to moderate the changes they cause. These properties of water are intimately connected to the biochemical and physical processes performed by living organisms, and life would be very different if these properties were altered, if it could exist at all.</p>

<p id="fs-idm117917360">Cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and lipids. The macromolecules are a subset of <span data-type="term">organic molecules</span> (any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are especially important for life. The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. The carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component, or &#8220;backbone,&#8221; of the macromolecules.</p>
<p id="fs-idm104312656">Individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six protons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. Therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. The methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical formula CH<sub>4</sub>. Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons. This results in a filled outermost shell.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp10455440"><h1 data-type="title">Hydrocarbons</h1>
<p id="fs-idm23065488"><span data-type="term">Hydrocarbons</span> are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) described above. We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels&#8212;like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many covalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which is released when these molecules are burned (oxidized). Methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The geometry of the methane molecule, where the atoms reside in three dimensions, is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a shape known as a tetrahedron, with four triangular faces; for this reason, methane is described as having tetrahedral geometry.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idp79833888">As the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or combinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and each type of bond affects the geometry of the molecule in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm174673488"><h2 data-type="title">Hydrocarbon Chains</h2>
<p id="fs-idp73286688">Hydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and may be branched or unbranched. Furthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds, illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the geometry of the molecule. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix &#8220;eth-,&#8221; which is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons. The suffixes &#8220;-ane,&#8221; &#8220;-ene,&#8221; and &#8220;-yne&#8221; refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butane, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the geometry of the molecule: single bonds allow rotation along the axis of the bond, whereas double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one. These geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_03_02" class=" "><figcaption>When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms, the shape is tetrahedral. When two carbon atoms form a double bond, the shape is planar, or flat.

<p id="fs-idm3136624"><span data-type="term">Functional groups</span> are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules. They are found along the &#8220;carbon backbone&#8221; of macromolecules. This carbon backbone is formed by chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen. Molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are <span data-type="term">substituted hydrocarbons</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp75409312">The functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or several different places along its chain and/or ring structure. Each of the four types of macromolecules&#8212;proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids&#8212;has its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its function in living organisms.</p>
<p id="fs-idm191060016">A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. Some of the important functional groups in biological molecules are shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_03_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>; they include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl. These groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids. This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO<sup>- </sup>group; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on. Other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic.</p>
