  <p id="delete_me">Welcome to <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics</em>, an OpenStax resource. This textbook has been created with several goals in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement&#8212;all while encouraging students toward high levels of academic scholarship. Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a strong foundation in economics in an accessible format. </p><section data-depth="1" id="eip-809"><h1 data-type="title">About OpenStax</h1><p id="eip-391">

They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet the needs of both instructors and students. </p><p id="eip-id1169327261430">The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. And to make it more applied, we have incorporated many current topics.  We hope students will be interested to know just how far-reaching the recent recession was (and still is), for example, and why there is so much controversy even among economists over the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The Keystone Pipeline, Occupy Wall Street, minimum wage debates, and the appointment of the United States&#8217; first female Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, are just a few of the other important topics covered. 

</p><p id="eip-id1169368893095">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary.  The outcome is a balanced approach to micro and macro economics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. New 2015 data are incorporated for topics that range from average U.S. household consumption in Chapter 2 to the total value of all home equity in Chapter 17. Current events are treated in a politically-balanced way as well.  

</p><p id="eip-734">The book is organized into eight main parts:</p><ul id="eip-679"><li><strong>What is Economics?</strong>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</li>
<li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>

<li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
<li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, cover the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
<li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The Expenditure-Output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>

<li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p><ul id="eip-213"><li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter&#8217;s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the Intro module) and the second at chapter&#8217;s end, when students have learned what&#8217;s necessary to understand the case and &#8220;bring home&#8221; the chapter&#8217;s core concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step-by-step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor&#8217;s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students&#8217; understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-651"><h2 data-type="title">Questions for Each Level of Learning</h2><p id="eip-454">
The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics</em> further expands on Taylor&#8217;s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end-of-module questions for students.  
</p><ul id="eip-284"><li><strong>Self-Checks:</strong> Are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They &#8220;click&#8211;to-reveal&#8221; an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think a bit beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Review Questions:</strong> Have been retained from Taylor&#8217;s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter and are in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions:</strong> Are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn&#8217;t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
<li><strong>Problems:</strong> Are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-780"><h2 data-type="title">Updated Art</h2><p id="eip-26">

Decisions in the Social Media Age</div><p id="fs-idm49900128">To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which route to take to class, to the more complex&#8212;&#8220;Should I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my education?&#8221; Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment; information economists call &#8220;imperfect&#8221; because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day. </p><p id="fs-idp9173408">And now, we have another avenue in which to gather information&#8212;social media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see, which products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university without checking out its Facebook page or Twitter stream first for information and feedback? </p>
<p id="fs-idp26732128">As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information is disseminated through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. &#8220;Economists love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,&#8221; says Jessica Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.</p><p id="fs-idm1264384">This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information, and understanding behavior in markets &#8212;the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter&#8217;s end&#8212;to &#8220;bring home&#8221; the concepts in play. </p>

<p id="fs-idp82671008"><span data-type="term">Economics</span> is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. <span data-type="term">Scarcity</span> means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 hours in the day to try to acquire the goods they want.   At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available. </p>
<p id="fs-idp23700000">Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158.6 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similarly, the total area of the United States is 3,794,101 square miles. These are large numbers for such crucial resources, however, they are limited. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem. </p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_003"><div data-type="title" class="title">Scarcity of Resources</div><figcaption>Homeless people are a stark reminder that scarcity of resources is real.

<p id="fs-idp30710144">If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone need food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of scarcity. Let&#8217;s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics. </p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp6791984"><h1 data-type="title">The Problem of Scarcity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm5464496">Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. Or if you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it? </p>

    </div><p id="fs-idm92457264">Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn&#8217;t enough money in the budget to do everything.  So why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? The simple answer is most of us do not know how, but that is not the main reason. (When you study economics, you will discover that the obvious choice is not always the right answer&#8212;or at least the complete answer. Studying economics teaches you to think in a different of way.) Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all&#8212;or any&#8212;of those things. It is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is something called <em data-effect="italics">the division and specialization of labor</em>, a production innovation first put forth by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Adam Smith</span>, <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, in his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>. </p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Adam Smith</div><figcaption>Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm47017248"><h1 data-type="title">The Division of and Specialization of Labor</h1> 
<p id="fs-idm75995888">The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723&#8211;1790) published his famous book <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em> in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the <span data-type="term">division of labor</span>, which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person. </p>
<p id="fs-idm95830048">To illustrate the division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that were often done by different people&#8212;all for a pin, believe it or not! </p>
<p id="fs-idm48990176">Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills&#8212;not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm44436912"><h1 data-type="title">Why the Division of Labor Increases Production</h1> 
<p id="fs-idm60480400">When the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith observed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to do two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons. </p>
<p id="fs-idm122368784">First, <span data-type="term">specialization</span> in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">comparative advantage</span>.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, specialization will be affected by geography&#8212;it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more productive than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not. </p>
<p id="fs-idm51470800">Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better. </p>
<p id="fs-idm10733072">A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its &#8220;<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">core competency</span>&#8221;) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products. </p><p id="fs-idm62291680">Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of <span data-type="term">economies of scale</span>, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity. </p>
</section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp36846976"><h1 data-type="title">Trade and Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idm25012544">Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade. </p>
<p id="fs-idp13130160">You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music&#8212;you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket&#8212;you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car&#8212;you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp73648"><h1 data-type="title">Why Study Economics?</h1> 
<p id="fs-idp132016">Now that we have gotten an overview on what economics studies, let&#8217;s quickly discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to be memorized, though there are plenty of important concepts to be learned. Instead, economics is better thought of as a collection of questions to be answered or puzzles to be worked out. Most important, economics provides the tools to work out those puzzles. If you have yet to be been bitten by the economics &#8220;bug,&#8221; there are other reasons why you should study economics. </p>
<ul id="fs-idm173232">
<li>Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial. </li>
<li>It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the &#8220;fiscal cliff,&#8221; what were the issues involved? Did you know? </li>
<li>A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer&#8217;s argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics. </li>
</ul>
<p id="fs-idm217296">The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.</p>
</section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm47378992" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm77971456">Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker. </p>

<p id="fs-idm15153168">Economics is concerned with the well-being of <em data-effect="italics">all</em> people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers&#8217; skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption. </p>
<p id="fs-idp4626272">It should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground. That ground can be divided into two parts: <span data-type="term">Microeconomics</span> focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses; <span data-type="term">Macroeconomics</span> looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy. </p><p id="fs-idm44860752">To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the entire ecosystem of the lake from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint. </p>
<p id="fs-idp5949552">Whether you are looking at lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live. </p>
<p id="fs-idm59615920">In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy; for example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the performance of the macroeconomy ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions made by individual households and businesses. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp49079232"><h1 data-type="title">Microeconomics </h1>
<p id="fs-idm5680000">What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means? </p>
<p id="fs-idp43150560">What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines what prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomic part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior and the theory of the firm. </p>
</section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm89833200"><h1 data-type="title">Macroeconomics</h1>
<p id="fs-idp23578512">What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines a nation&#8217;s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay workers off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term? </p>
<p id="fs-idm36646496">An economy's macroeconomic health can be defined by a number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals? <span data-type="term">Monetary policy</span>, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets, is conducted by a nation&#8217;s central bank. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. <span data-type="term">Fiscal policy</span>, which involves government spending and taxes, is determined by a nation&#8217;s legislative body. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are the main tools the government has to work with. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that will be explored in the macroeconomic chapters of this book. </p>

<p id="fs-idm180944">Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy. </p>

<p id="fs-idp136951760"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">John Maynard Keynes</span> (1883&#8211;1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist&#8217;s book: &#8220;[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.&#8221; In other words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to think. </p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp57248112" class="note economics linkup"><p id="fs-idp159987488">Watch this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Keynes">video</a> about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics.</p>

    </div><p id="fs-idp34661824">Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline.  They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior, that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A <span data-type="term">theory</span> is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other.   The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to be understood, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation being studied. </p>
<p id="fs-idp129892576">Sometimes economists use the term <span data-type="term">model</span> instead of theory.  Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is more applied or empirical representation.  Models are used to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably. </p>
<p id="fs-idp7072">For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product will be, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work. </p>
<p id="fs-idp123790320">A good model to start with in economics is the <span data-type="term">circular flow diagram</span>, which is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups&#8212;households and firms&#8212;that interact in two markets: the <span data-type="term">goods and services market</span> in which firms sell and households buy and the <span data-type="term">labor market</span> in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees. </p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Circular Flow Diagram</div><figcaption>The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm122026608" data-alt="The circular flow diagram&#8217;s outer arrows represent a goods and services market, and the inner arrows represent a labor market.

As illustrated by the inner arrows, in a labor market, households provide labor to firms and, in exchange, firms give wages, salaries, and benefits to households.">

As illustrated by the inner arrows, in a labor market, households provide labor to firms and, in exchange, firms give wages, salaries, and benefits to households."/>
      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="fs-idp5860544">Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. This is shown in the outer circle, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries and benefits. This is shown in the inner circle and represents the two sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms demand. </p>
<p id="fs-idp44237760">This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports). </p>
<p id="fs-idp5279008">Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. In economics, theories are expressed as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. Both micro and macroeconomics are explained in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others. </p>

<p id="fs-idm116325952">Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done? </p>
<p id="fs-idm2603472">There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy. The first is the <span data-type="term">traditional economy</span>, which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops they have always grown using traditional methods. What you produce is what you get to consume. Because things are driven by tradition, there is little economic progress or development. </p>

      </span>
      
    </figure>

<p id="fs-idm22896400">Command economies are very different. In a <span data-type="term">command economy</span>, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord&#8217;s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies. </p>
<p id="fs-idp38251936">In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices will be charged for them. The government decides what methods of production will be used and how much workers will be paid. Many necessities like healthcare and education are provided for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies. </p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Market Economy</div><figcaption>Nothing says &#8220;market&#8221; more than The New York Stock Exchange.

      </span>
      
    </figure><p id="fs-idp41834384">Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A <span data-type="term">market</span> is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together. In a <span data-type="term">market economy</span>, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on <span data-type="term">private enterprise</span>: the means of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals. Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, resources and businesses are owned by the government.) What goods and services are supplied depends on what is demanded. A person&#8217;s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person&#8217;s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James).  In this scenario, economic decisions are determined by market forces, not governments.  </p>
<p id="fs-idm91198544">Most economies in the real world are mixed; they combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than does the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while they are closer to having a market-oriented system now than several decades ago, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. A rich resource of information about countries and their economies can be found on the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s website, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm78296032" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What countries are considered economically free?</div><p id="fs-idp651728">Who is in control of economic decisions?

Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the <em data-effect="italics">Wall Street Journal</em> look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world.

<p id="fs-idp121002496">Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the &#8220;rules of the game&#8221; in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations&#8212;ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated. Heavily regulated economies often have <span data-type="term">underground economies</span>, which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government&#8217;s approval. </p>
<p id="fs-idp9942944">The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm87109856"><h1 data-type="title">The Rise of Globalization</h1><p id="fs-idm66053168">Recent decades have seen a trend toward <span data-type="term">globalization</span>, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders&#8212;in other words, international trade and financial capital flows. </p>
<p id="fs-idm185091664">Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information&#8212;for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade. </p>
<p id="fs-idm189846048"><a href="#Table_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013, according to an entity known as The World Bank. <span data-type="term">Exports</span> are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad. <span data-type="term">Imports</span> are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically. The size of total production in an economy is measured by the <span data-type="term">gross domestic product (GDP)</span>. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country&#8217;s total economic production is sold in other countries. </p><table id="Table_01_02" summary=" This table has five columns and fifteen rows.

      </tbody></table><p id="fs-idm154635744">In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries. </p>
<p id="fs-idm149456880"><a href="#Table_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> also shows that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections. </p><p id="fs-idm6274640">So, hopefully, you now have an idea of what economics is about. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called <a href="/contents/36286f6b-c879-48bd-b550-47f07b1c8b32@7">The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics</a>.

Decisions in the Social Media Age</div><p id="fs-idm87405776">The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer&#8217;s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested. </p><p id="fs-idm106900864">Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. Facebook post topics range from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.</p><p id="fs-idm62985712">Information helps us make decisions. Decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters should be sent to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If ten reporters are sent to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the knowledge needed to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics! </p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp128560112" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Choices ... To What Degree?</div>
<p id="fs-idp20173280">In 2015, the median income for workers who hold master's degrees varies from males to females. The average of the two is $2,951 weekly. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of $153,452. Compare that to the median weekly earnings for a full-time worker over 25 with no higher than a bachelor&#8217;s degree: $1,224 weekly and $63,648 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2015? They earn just $664 weekly and $34,528 over 12 months. In other words, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree boosted salaries 54% over what you would have earned if you had stopped your education after high school. A master&#8217;s degree yields a salary almost double that of a high school diploma.</p><p id="fs-idp159623856">Given these statistics, we might expect a lot of people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor&#8217;s degree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those choices that give them the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88% of the population in the United States had a high school diploma, only 33.6% of 25&#8211;65 year olds had bachelor&#8217;s degrees, and only 7.4% of 25&#8211;65 year olds in 2014 had earned a master&#8217;s.</p><p id="fs-idp185614208">This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists go about explaining those choices.</p>

<p id="fs-idm53392480">In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Always Get What You Want.&#8221; Economists chuckled, because they had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898&#8211;1984), in his <em data-effect="italics">Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science</em> in 1932, described not always getting what you want in this way:</p>


<p id="fs-idp187379536"><blockquote id="fs-idp57104384">The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose between the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.</blockquote></p> 



<p id="fs-idm121643872">Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences they wish. Neither can society.</p>
<p id="fs-idm117745376">This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing three critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how choices <em data-effect="italics">are</em> made or how they <em data-effect="italics">should</em> be made.</p>

<p id="fs-idm3622544">Consider the typical consumer&#8217;s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows Alphonso&#8217;s <span data-type="term">budget constraint</span>, that is, the outer boundary of his <span data-type="term">opportunity set</span>. The opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget. The budget constraint indicates all the combinations of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford when he exhausts his budget, given the prices of the two goods. (There are actually many different kinds of budget constraints. You will learn more about them in the chapter on <a href="/contents/198dae63-bd11-4014-9892-3de3b1b79191@9" class="target-chapter">Consumer Choices</a>.)</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Budget Constraint: Alphonso&#8217;s Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier </div><figcaption>Each point on the budget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso&#8217;s budget of $10. The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of burgers and bus tickets. All along the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm18308576" data-alt="The graph shows the budget line as a downward slope representing the opportunity set of burgers and bus tickets.">

</span>

</figure>



<p id="fs-idp125876208">The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per week.) But if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. This choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers) is shown by point A in the figure. Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. This alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers) is shown by point F.</p>



<p id="fs-idm57338768">If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that connects points A and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.</p>
<p id="fs-idm16134704">The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that&#8217;s not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his budget? The answer is four bus tickets. That is the true cost to Alphonso of one more burger.</p>



<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm94573472"><h1 data-type="title">The Concept of Opportunity Cost</h1>
<p id="fs-idm58422240">Economists use the term <span data-type="term">opportunity cost</span> to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else; in short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative&#8212;in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to get other things they desire more.</p>

<p id="fs-idm60005344">A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class (not recommended, by the way), the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.</p>

<p id="fs-idm29379104">Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is &#8722;0.25, indicating that for every four bus tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.</p><p id="fs-idm65887504">There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, the slope is defined as the price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. So if you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp49096768"><h1 data-type="title">Identifying Opportunity Cost</h1>
<p id="fs-idp54198192">In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price</span>. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $300, then $300 measures the amount of &#8220;other consumption&#8221; that he has given up. For practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that could have been bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.</p>
<p id="fs-idp21685264">For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to &#8220;build team spirit.&#8221; The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. But an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.</p>
<p id="fs-idp51848832">Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. But in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.</p>


<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm59463856" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?</div>
<p id="fs-idm119986192">After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the federal government could provide armed &#8220;sky marshals&#8221; who would travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.</p>
<p id="fs-idm76729648">But the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), more than 800 million passengers took plane trips in the United States in 2012. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million &#215; 0.5 hours &#215; $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.</p>
</div>



<p id="fs-idm36947072">In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). $5 each day does not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up to in a year&#8212;250 days a year &#215; $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent vacation. If the opportunity cost is described as &#8220;a nice vacation&#8221; instead of &#8220;$5 a day,&#8221; you might make different choices.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm54432448"><h1 data-type="title">Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility</h1>
<p id="fs-idp60642448">The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve <span data-type="term">marginal analysis</span>, which means comparing the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good.</p>
<p id="fs-idm50547376">People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or <span data-type="term">utility</span> those goods and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on <a href="/contents/198dae63-bd11-4014-9892-3de3b1b79191@9" class="target-chapter">Consumer Choices</a>, is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility&#8212;perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor&#8217;s appointment. But later bus rides might provide much less utility&#8212;they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the <span data-type="term">law of diminishing marginal utility</span>, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.</p><p id="fs-idm29364672">The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, &#8220;My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.&#8221; Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: &#8220;I enjoy leisure, so I&#8217;ll never work.&#8221; Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm181756608"><h1 data-type="title">Sunk Costs</h1>
<p id="fs-idm91669040">In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that <span data-type="term">sunk costs</span>, which are costs that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.</p>
<p id="fs-idm151708912">Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is feeling kindly, Selena will not get a refund. But staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something&#8212;anything&#8212;else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.</p>
<p id="fs-idm172454896">For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. But the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp138429104"><h1 data-type="title">From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods</h1>
<p id="fs-idm36206528">The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. Or in more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that was presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm131301904" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm25836064">Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people&#8217;s desires exceed what is possible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must give up something that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity set, illustrates the range of choices available. The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the choices. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.</p>
<p id="fs-idm87796544">Opportunity cost measures cost by what is given up in exchange. Sometimes opportunity cost can be measured in money, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that must be given up.</p>
<p id="fs-idm116712832">Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something&#8212;whether it is a specific good or another resource&#8212;the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.</p>

<p id="fs-idm45922288">Suppose Alphonso&#8217;s town raised the price of bus tickets to $1 per trip (while the price of burgers stayed at $2 and his budget remained $10 per week.) Draw Alphonso&#8217;s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus tickets?</p></div>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm65109504"><p id="fs-idp34096288">The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is flatter than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the horizontal intercept, flattening as it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.</p>

<p id="fs-idp8409600">Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society, using a model called the <span data-type="term">production possibilities frontier (PPF)</span>. There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.</p>
<p id="fs-idp154544320">Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education. This situation is illustrated by the production possibilities frontier in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>


<figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_010"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier </div><figcaption>This production possibilities frontier shows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all resources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to education.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm22869664" data-alt=" The graph shows that a society has limited resources and often must prioritize where to invest. On this graph, the y-axis is &#698;Healthcare,&#698; and the x-axis is &#698;Education.&#698;">

</span>

</figure>


<p id="fs-idp20648192">In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, healthcare is shown on the vertical axis and education is shown on the horizontal axis. If the society were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. But it would not have any resources to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education shown on the production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. But it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.</p>

<p id="fs-idp154233824">Most important, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up. Just as with Alphonso&#8217;s budget constraint, the opportunity cost is shown by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">slope</span> of the production possibilities frontier. By now you might be saying, &#8220;Hey, this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint.&#8221; If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm66189760" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What&#8217;s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?</div> 
<p id="fs-idm109827760">There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two goods. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. The second is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available. An additional reason for the lack of numbers is that there is no single way to measure levels of education and healthcare. However, when you think of improvements in education, you can think of accomplishments like more years of school completed, fewer high-school dropouts, and higher scores on standardized tests. When you think of improvements in healthcare, you can think of longer life expectancies, lower levels of infant mortality, and fewer outbreaks of disease.</p><p id="fs-idm22295248">Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. The additional education is measured by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the &#8220;rise&#8221;) over the horizontal distance (the &#8220;run&#8221;). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.</p>
</div>


<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm97675840"><h1 data-type="title">The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns</h1>
<p id="fs-idm154285040">The budget constraints presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the slope of the budget constraint was determined by relative prices of the two goods in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">consumption budget constraint</span>. However, the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education was drawn as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?</p>
<p id="fs-idm188408336">To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.</p>
<p id="fs-idm69699056">Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting <em data-effect="italics">all</em> spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.</p>
<p id="fs-idm143176752">The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional marginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.</p>
<p id="fs-idm95341392">This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name: the <span data-type="term">law of diminishing returns</span>, which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large. But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.</p>
<p id="fs-idm122104624">The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. In this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp175845152"><h1 data-type="title">Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency</h1>
<p id="fs-idp127138400">The study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">cost</span>, while an efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.</p>
<p id="fs-idp98661104">The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.</p>




<figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_011"><div data-type="title" class="title">Productive and Allocative Efficiency </div><figcaption>Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods being produced&#8212;that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier&#8212;represents the allocation that society most desires.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp112798384" data-alt="The graph shows that when a greater quantity of one good increases, the quantity of other goods will decrease. Point R on the graph represents the good that drops in quantity as a result of greater efficiency in producing other goods.">

Point R on the graph represents the good that drops in quantity as a result of greater efficiency in producing other goods."/>
</span>

</figure>


<p id="fs-idm11333488"><span data-type="term">Productive efficiency</span> means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.</p>
<p id="fs-idm60596048">For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E<sub>2</sub> is greater than E<sub>1</sub>), and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H<sub>2</sub> is great than H<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p id="fs-idm113652816">The particular mix of goods and services being produced&#8212;that is, the specific combination of healthcare and education chosen along the production possibilities frontier&#8212;can be shown as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10582096"><span data-type="term">Allocative efficiency</span> means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.</p>

<p id="fs-idp14240416">Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods.</p>
<p id="fs-idm64644720">But improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. So, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">firm</span> level, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">market economy</span> coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. But for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="eip-924"><h1 data-type="title">The PPF and Comparative Advantage </h1><p id="eip-796">
While every society must choose how much of each good it should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country&#8217;s PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology or skills. 
</p>
<p id="eip-id1168241961980">Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce a lot of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce a lot of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane.  Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true; the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. This can be illustrated by the PPFs of the two countries in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_012"><div data-type="title" class="title">Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil </div><figcaption>The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity cost of wheat in term of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil.

In image (b), the U.S.&#8217;s Sugar Cane production is nearly half the production of its wheat."/>
</span>

</figure><p id="eip-971">When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a <span data-type="term">comparative advantage</span> in that good. In our example, Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane.  The opposite is true for the U.S. If the U.S. moved from point A to B and produced only sugar cane, this would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of foregone wheat production. 
</p><p id="eip-70">The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on <a href="/contents/775b09e9-28b2-4520-b310-622dd743120a@6">International Trade</a> you will learn that countries&#8217; differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods that they have comparative advantage in, and trade part of that production for goods they do not have comparative advantage in. With trade, goods are produced where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties. </p></section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm78431728" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm107669536">A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and services it can produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.</p>
<p id="fs-idp13988016">The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing something, the marginal increase in output will become smaller and smaller. All choices along a production possibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society&#8217;s resources to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production possibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods they have comparative advantage in and trade some of their production for the remaining goods. </p></section>

</div></div><div data-type="page"><div data-type="document-title">Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach</div><div data-type="abstract"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making</li>
<li>Interpret a tradeoff diagram</li>
<li>Contrast normative statements and positive statements</li>
</ul></div>



<p id="fs-idp88727232">It is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let&#8217;s consider these arguments in turn.</p>  



<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm27124944"><h1 data-type="title">First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This</h1>
<p id="fs-idm110378752">The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn&#8217;t look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10349392">However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions even so. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of the ball. But when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm1376720">Someone might argue: &#8220;The scientist&#8217;s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes are actually made.&#8221; This reaction would be wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.</p>
<p id="fs-idm15337952">Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who goes shopping for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. So, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis.  For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on <a href="/contents/198dae63-bd11-4014-9892-3de3b1b79191@9">Consumer Choices</a>.</p></section>



<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm6498768"><h1 data-type="title">Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way</h1>
<p id="fs-idp39718608">The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to these concerns.</p>
<p id="fs-idm100951328">First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between <span data-type="term">positive statements</span>, which describe the world as it is, and <span data-type="term">normative statements</span>, which describe how the world should be. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worth doing&#8212;an example of positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens&#8212;an example of normative analysis.</p>
<p id="fs-idp39743760">Even if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Adam Smith</span>, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The opening sentence of his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>, puts it very clearly: &#8220;How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.&#8221; Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.</p>
<p id="fs-idp4775504">Second, self-interested behavior and profit-seeking can be labeled with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend a lot of money on themselves. Others may earn a lot of money and give it to charity or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require a great deal of time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that does not take lots of their time or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their own business. People&#8217;s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.</p>



<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm90076880" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Is a diagram by any other name the same?</div>
<p id="fs-idm23901664">When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams: diagrams in the text, diagrams in the lectures, diagrams in the problems, and diagrams on exams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each of the individual diagrams.</p>
<p id="fs-idm59650928">This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although it is presented with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.</p>
<p id="fs-idm37958336">The first theme is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">scarcity</span>. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains&#8212;just at a different level. The second theme is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">tradeoffs</span>. As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint, the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers are represented by a curved line because the law of diminishing returns holds that as resources are added to an area, the marginal gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.</p>
<p id="fs-idm42608432">The third theme is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">economic efficiency</span>, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual&#8217;s budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.</p>
<p id="fs-idm35091920">The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, labor supply versus leisure, saving versus consumption, environmental protection and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not be confused by the different labels. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Tradeoff Diagram </div><figcaption>Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp73277088" data-alt="Two graphs will occur frequently throughout the text. They represent the possible outcomes of constraints/production of goods.

</span>

</figure>
</div>



<p id="fs-idp47826144">Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>, christened this property the <span data-type="term">invisible hand</span>. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:</p>
<p id="fs-idp96677296"><blockquote id="fs-idp130687056">Every individual&#8230;generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention&#8230;By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.</blockquote></p><p id="fs-idm2780352">The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish individual actions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp17061536">Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. But then you might turn around and focus on other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.</p>


<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm3333744" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Choices ... To What Degree?</div>
<p id="fs-idm103153136">What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. So, an economist might argue that people do not go on to get bachelor&#8217;s degrees or master&#8217;s degrees because they do not have the resources to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor&#8217;s degree or a master&#8217;s degree may not be available in their opportunity set.</p>
<p id="fs-idm97709104">The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor&#8217;s degree or a master&#8217;s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of giving up years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1767648">Finally, the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">intertemporal choices</span>. An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than putting that consumption off until after they graduate college.</p>

<p id="fs-idm151027680">The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior.

Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how they should behave.</p>

<p id="fs-idp55859248">(This appendix should be consulted after first reading <a href="/contents/2600d768-e2cf-4eb7-a936-db24ea0a10a8" class="target-chapter">Welcome to Economics!</a>) Economics is not math. There is no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool that can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.</p><p id="fs-idp141516464">There are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you specify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:</p>

   <ul id="fs-idp9396560">
      <li>What a function is</li>
      <li>How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)</li>
      <li>How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)</li>
      <li>How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)</li>
      <li>How to read and manipulate a graph</li>
    </ul>

<p id="fs-idm90918496">In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider learning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp12777936"><h1 data-type="title">Algebraic Models</h1>
<p id="fs-idp163417056">Often economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">function</span> describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob + Shawn + Margaret.</p>
<p id="fs-idp169955968">Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being explained (&#8220;the effect&#8221;). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (&#8220;the causes&#8221;). For example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp98482096"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>GPA&#160;=&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;combined_SAT&#160;+&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;class_attendance&#160;+&#160;0.50&#160;&#215;&#160;hours_spent_studying</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>GPA&#160;=&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;combined_SAT&#160;+&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;class_attendance&#160;+&#160;0.50&#160;&#215;&#160;hours_spent_studying</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idp86730304">This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.</p>
<p id="fs-idp75133536">Of course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget = money_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are economics books and music.</p>
<p id="fs-idp151044960">Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:</p>

<p id="fs-idp93748496"><strong data-effect="bold">Expressing Equations Graphically</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm77907312">Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display statistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.</p>
<p id="fs-idp253633648">To a mathematician or an economist, a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">variable</span> is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this equation works, consider a numerical example:</p>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp51829088">This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the slope. Remember that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">slope</span> is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope&#8212;that is, specifying b and m in the equation for a line&#8212;will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation of actual data.</p>
<p id="fs-idp41539504"><strong data-effect="bold">Interpreting the Slope</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp111178496">The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">positive slope</span> means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> later in this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is, firms will supply more when the price is higher.</p>
<p id="fs-idp150995232">A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">negative slope</span> means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> later in this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.</p>
<p id="fs-idm28729904">A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.</p>
<p id="fs-idp29064288">The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as the &#8220;starting point&#8221; and the other point as the &#8220;end point&#8221; and then calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:</p>

<p id="fs-idp75262304">Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next 1,000 meters</p>
<p id="fs-idp3737664">Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has an infinite slope.</p>
<p id="fs-idm8728560">Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.</p>

Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and &#8211;0.4, and the slopes are &#8211;0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp66195488"><h1 data-type="title">Growth Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idp39003328">Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">growth rate</span> is simply the percentage change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business&#8217;s sales. It could be a nation&#8217;s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp66186672"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Percentage&#160;change</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Change&#160;in&#160;quantity</mtext><mtext>Quantity</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Percentage&#160;change</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Change&#160;in&#160;quantity</mtext><mtext>Quantity</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div><p id="fs-idm49335232">Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2 per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.</p>
<p id="fs-idm52797040">To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity&#8212;or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a nation&#8217;s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion &#8211; $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:</p>

If you need a rough approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.</p>
<p id="fs-idm28526496">A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.</p>
<p id="fs-idp26419920">The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm151891888"><h1 data-type="title">Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph</h1><p id="fs-idm159329680">Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.</p>
<p id="fs-idm112471792">Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers&#8217; perceptions of the relationships in the data.</p>

<p id="fs-idm65243872"><strong data-effect="bold">Line Graphs</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm36697552">The graphs we have discussed so far are called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">line graphs</span>, because they show a relationship between two variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.</p>
<p id="fs-idm75230912">Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in <a href="#Table_A_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is displayed in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life. (The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">median</span> means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to check whether a child&#8217;s physical development is roughly on track.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A01_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls </div><figcaption>The line graph shows the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years.

In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms.

<p id="fs-idm12993392">The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent averages. If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights, some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20827792">One common line graph is called a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">time series</span>, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of adults who want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the unemployment rate in each year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008&#8211;2009.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A01_025"><div data-type="title" class="title">U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975&#8211;2014</div><figcaption>This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment data.

<p id="fs-idm13540288">In a pie graph, each slice of the pie represents a share of the total, or a percentage. For example, 50% would be half of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie.

The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the different age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers and percentages in the table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the population into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into categories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main categories.</p>

<p id="fs-idp127597376"><strong data-effect="bold">Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp93924688">Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for your data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.</p>
<p id="fs-idm32870480">Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of different countries, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different groups within the population.</p>
<p id="fs-idm23342592">A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate over time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold, the size of the economy.</p><p id="fs-idp26205536"><strong data-effect="bold">How Graphs Can Be Misleading</strong></p>

<p id="fs-idm89821600">A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%, <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (d) makes it look larger.</p>
<p id="fs-idm125921968">Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year- to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.</p><p id="fs-idm155257232">A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (g), however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its &#8220;original&#8221; level&#8212;which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high point around 1975.</p><p id="fs-idm64146304">These kinds of tricks&#8212;or shall we just call them &#8220;presentation choices&#8221;&#8212; are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.</p>
<p id="fs-idm134027216">Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick impression from a graph. View with caution.</p>

<p id="fs-idm44564944">Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.</p>
<p id="fs-idm51750880">Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into segments to show subgroups.</p>
<p id="fs-idp5680752">Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.</p>

<p id="fs-idp37189312">Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people&#8217;s preferences. In <a href="/contents/198dae63-bd11-4014-9892-3de3b1b79191@9" class="target-chapter">Consumer Choices</a>, the level of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">utility</span> that a person receives is described in numerical terms. This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility. By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility&#8212;an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic&#8212;the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">indifference curve</span> framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp76101520"><h1 data-type="title">What Is an Indifference Curve?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp26395136">People cannot really put a numerical value on their level of satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify what choices would give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An indifference curve shows combinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. For example, <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents three indifference curves that represent Lilly&#8217;s preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main relaxation activities: eating doughnuts and reading paperback books. Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh) represents one level of utility. First we will explore the meaning of one particular indifference curve and then we will look at the indifference curves as a group.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">Lilly&#8217;s Indifference Curves </div><figcaption>Lilly would receive equal utility from all points on a given indifference curve. Any points on the highest indifference curve Uh, like F, provide greater utility than any points like A, B, C, and D on the middle indifference curve Um. Similarly, any points on the middle indifference curve Um provide greater utility than any points on the lowest indifference curve Ul.</figcaption>

    </span>
    
  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp18962080"><strong data-effect="bold">The Shape of an Indifference Curve</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp80083344">The indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D. Since an indifference curve represents a set of choices that have the same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility, judged according to her personal preferences, from two books and 120 doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84 doughnuts (point B) from 11 books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts (point D). She would also receive the same utility from any of the unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference curve.</p>
<p id="eip-473">Indifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they are downward sloping from left to right; 2) they are convex with respect to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The downward slope of the indifference curve means that Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of the other, while holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um, which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility. Thus, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">marginal utility</span> that Lilly would gain from, say, increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84&#8212;so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B. Indeed, the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">marginal rate of substitution</span>, which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same. </p><p id="fs-idp27716080">Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The reason behind this shape involves diminishing marginal utility&#8212;the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the marginal utility from each additional unit becomes lower. Compare two different choices between points that all provide Lilly an equal amount of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B, and between C and D. In both choices, Lilly consumes one more book, but between A and B her consumption of doughnuts falls by 36 (from 120 to 84) and between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The reason for this difference is that points A and C are different starting points, and thus have different implications for marginal utility. At point A, Lilly has few books and many doughnuts. Thus, her marginal utility from an extra book will be relatively high while the marginal utility of additional doughnuts is relatively low&#8212;so on the margin, it will take a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility from the marginal book. At point C, however, Lilly has many books and few doughnuts. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high&#8212;so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution&#8212;that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant&#8212;also changes, as a result of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">diminishing marginal utility</span> of both goods.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11855696"><strong data-effect="bold">The Field of Indifference Curves</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm14714032">Each indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single level of utility. Every level of utility will have its own indifference curve. Thus, Lilly&#8217;s preferences will include an infinite number of indifference curves lying nestled together on the diagram&#8212;even though only three of the indifference curves, representing three levels of utility, appear on <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. In other words, an infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn on this diagram&#8212;but you should remember that they exist.</p>
<p id="fs-idp40568336">Higher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than lower ones. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, indifference curve Ul can be thought of as a &#8220;low&#8221; level of utility, while Um is a &#8220;medium&#8221; level of utility and Uh is a &#8220;high&#8221; level of utility. All of the choices on indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on indifference curve Um, which in turn are preferred to all of the choices on Ul.</p>
<p id="fs-idp103170864">To understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones, compare point B on indifference curve Um to point F on indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books (five to three) and doughnuts (100 to 84), so point F is clearly preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference curve&#8212;that all the points on the curve have the same level of utility&#8212;if point F on indifference curve Uh is preferred to point B on indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on indifference curve Uh have a higher level of utility than all points on Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve, like Ul, you can identify a point on a higher indifference curve like Um or Uh that has a higher consumption of both goods. Since one point on the higher indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve, and since all the points on a given indifference curve have the same level of utility, it must be true that all points on higher indifference curves have greater utility than all points on lower indifference curves.</p>
<p id="fs-idm9387904">These arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher or lower levels of utility do not require any numerical estimates of utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based on the assumptions that when people have less of one good they need more of another good to make up for it, if they are keeping the same level of utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility they receive from additional units of that good will diminish. Given these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference curves can be mapped out to describe the preferences of any individual.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11794112"><strong data-effect="bold">The Individuality of Indifference Curves</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp80391248">Each person determines their own preferences and utility. Thus, while indifference curves have the same general shape&#8212;they slope down, and the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right&#8212;the specific shape of indifference curves can be different for every person. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, for example, applies only to Lilly&#8217;s preferences. Indifference curves for other people would probably travel through different points.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm112091376"><h1 data-type="title">Utility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves</h1>
<p id="fs-idm33748048">People seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to be on the highest possible indifference curve. However, people are limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are actually possible.</p>

<p id="fs-idp12097456"><strong data-effect="bold">Maximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp60715712">Return to the situation of Lilly&#8217;s choice between paperback books and doughnuts. Say that books cost $6, doughnuts are 50 cents each, and that Lilly has $60 to spend. This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Along with the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">budget line</span> are shown the three indifference curves from <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. What is Lilly&#8217;s utility-maximizing choice? Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">Indifference Curves and a Budget Constraint </div><figcaption>Lilly&#8217;s preferences are shown by the indifference curves. Lilly&#8217;s budget constraint, given the prices of books and doughnuts and her income, is shown by the straight line. Lilly&#8217;s optimal choice will be point B, where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve Um. Lilly would have more utility at a point like F on the higher indifference curve Uh, but the budget line does not touch the higher indifference curve Uh at any point, so she cannot afford this choice. A choice like G is affordable to Lilly, but it lies on indifference curve Ul and thus provides less utility than choice B, which is on indifference curve Um.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm37597008" data-alt="The graph shows indifferences curves Ul, Um, and Uh which highlight the following choices based on her options of books (the x-axis) and doughnuts (the y-axis): A (2, 120); B (3, 84); F (5, 100); G (6, 48); H (3, 70).">

    </span>
    
  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp4802784">The choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable, since it is on the highest indifference curve Uh of those shown in the diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly&#8217;s budget constraint. The choice of H with three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside Lilly&#8217;s budget set, and as a utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget constraint itself. Choices B and G are both on the opportunity set. However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower indifference curve Ul than choice B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the indifference curve Um. If Lilly were to start at choice G, and then thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from doughnuts and books, she would decide that some additional doughnuts and fewer books would make her happier&#8212;which would cause her to move toward her preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly&#8217;s personal preferences, as identified by her indifference curves, and Lilly&#8217;s opportunity set, which is determined by prices and income, B will be her utility-maximizing choice.</p>
<p id="fs-idm31026336">The highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at a single point of tangency. Since an infinite number of indifference curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram, there will always exist one indifference curve that touches the budget line at a single point of tangency. All higher indifference curves, like Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices on that indifference curve would provide higher utility, they are not affordable given the budget set. All lower indifference curves, like Ul, will cross the budget line in two separate places. When one indifference curve crosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be another, higher, attainable indifference curve sitting above it that touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm3420224"><h1 data-type="title">Changes in Income</h1>
<p id="fs-idm93397552">A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In graphical terms, the new <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">budget constraint</span> will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve, representing a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for example, 50%, exactly how much will a person alter consumption of books and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%? Or will the quantity of one good rise substantially, while the quantity of the other good rises only a little, or even declines?</p>
<p id="fs-idm91203856">Since personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are different for each individual, the response to changes in income will be different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and Natasha in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) and <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). They each start with an identical income of $40, which they spend on yogurts that cost $1 and rental movies that cost $4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based on Manuel&#8217;s preferences, as revealed by his indifference curves, his utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set occurs where his opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at W, with three movies and 28 yogurts, while Natasha&#8217;s utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set at Y will be seven movies and 12 yogurts.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">Manuel and Natasha&#8217;s Indifference Curves </div><figcaption>Manuel and Natasha originally face the same budget constraints; that is, same prices and same income. However, the indifference curves that illustrate their preferences are not the same. (a) Manuel&#8217;s original choice at W involves more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the higher income by mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha&#8217;s original choice (Y) involves relatively more movies, but she reacts to the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when budget constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different original choices and to different reactions in response to a change in income.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm101396496" data-alt="Both images in the graph show &#8220;rental movies&#8221; on the x-axis and &#8220;yogurts&#8221; on the y-axis.

    </span>
    
  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm72005296">Now, say that income rises to $60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their budget constraints shift to the right. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), Manuel&#8217;s new utility maximizing choice at X will be seven movies and 32 yogurts&#8212;that is, Manuel will choose to spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha&#8217;s new utility maximizing choice at Z will be eight movies and 28 yogurts&#8212;that is, she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In this way, the indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible responses. However, if both goods are normal goods, then the typical response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of them&#8212;although exactly how much more is a matter of personal preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response to a higher level of income will be to purchase less of it.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140057303235616"><h1 data-type="title">Responses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140057303201104">A higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, so that it is tangent to a lower indifference curve representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a good will cause the opportunity set to shift to the right, so that it is tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an increased level of utility. Exactly how much a change in price will lead to the quantity demanded of each good will depend on personal preferences.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057307596928">Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an income effect. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">substitution effect</span> is that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out substitutes. If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples, grapefruit, or raisins. Conversely, when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward consuming more. If oranges get cheaper, people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">income effect</span> refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one&#8217;s income. If the price of a good that you have been buying falls, then in effect your buying power has risen&#8212;you are able to purchase more goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that you have been buying rises, then the buying power of a given amount of income is diminished. (One common source of confusion is that the &#8220;income effect&#8221; does not refer to a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the situation in which the price of a good changes, and thus the quantities of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of income change. It might be more accurate to call the &#8220;income effect&#8221; a &#8220;buying power effect,&#8221; but the &#8220;income effect&#8221; terminology has been used for decades, and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a price changes, consumers feel the pull of both substitution and income effects at the same time.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057303855376">Using indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and income effects on a graph. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, Ogden faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts cost $20, personal pizzas cost $6, and he has $120 to spend.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">Substitution and Income Effects </div><figcaption>The original choice is A, the point of tangency between the original budget constraint and indifference curve. The new choice is B, the point of tangency between the new budget constraint and the lower indifference curve. Point C is the tangency between the dashed line, where the slope shows the new higher price of haircuts, and the original indifference curve. The substitution effect is the shift from A to C, which means getting fewer haircuts and more pizza. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction in buying power that causes a shift from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, with relative prices remaining unchanged. The income effect results in less consumed of both goods. Both substitution and income effects cause fewer haircuts to be consumed. For pizza, in this case, the substitution effect and income effect cancel out, leading to the same amount of pizza consumed.</figcaption>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp140057303178336">The price of haircuts rises to $30. Ogden starts at choice A on the higher <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">opportunity set</span> and the higher indifference curve. After the price of pizza increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve. Point B with two haircuts and 10 personal pizzas is immediately below point A with three haircuts and 10 personal pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of haircuts by cutting back only on haircuts, while leaving his consumption of pizza unchanged.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057308914288">The dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the substitution effect and the income effect. To understand their function, start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How would Ogden change his consumption if the relative prices of the two goods changed, but this change in relative prices did not affect his utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the two goods; thus, the slope of the original budget line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of the new budget line is determined by the new relative prices. With this thought in mind, the dashed line is a graphical tool inserted in a specific way: It is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget constraint, so it reflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original level of utility or buying power.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057308914672">Thus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a substitution effect; it shows the choice that Ogden would make if relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the original budget set and the dashed line) but if buying power did not shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference curve). The substitution effect will encourage people to shift away from the good which has become relatively more expensive&#8212;in Ogden&#8217;s case, the haircuts on the vertical axis&#8212;and toward the good which has become relatively less expensive&#8212;in this case, the pizza on the vertical axis. The two arrows labeled with &#8220;s&#8221; for &#8220;substitution effect,&#8221; one on each axis, show the direction of this movement.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057303335264">The income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how Ogden reacts to a reduction in his buying power from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant the relative prices (because the dashed line has the same slope as the new budget constraint). In this case, where the price of one good increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that consumption of both goods should fall (if they are both normal goods, which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to believe otherwise). The two arrows labeled with &#8220;i&#8221; for &#8220;income effect,&#8221; one on each axis, show the direction of this income effect movement.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057311359168">Now, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed less of it, for two reasons shown in the exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume less and the income effect of the higher price also led him to consume less. However, when the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed the same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for pizza meant that haircuts became relatively less expensive (compared to pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for pizza meant that he wished to consume less of both goods, and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume fewer haircuts. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, in this particular example the substitution effect and income effect on Ogden&#8217;s consumption of haircuts are offsetting&#8212;so he ends up consuming the same quantity of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057308919008">The size of these income and substitution effects will differ from person to person, depending on individual preferences. For example, if Ogden&#8217;s substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially strong, and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of haircuts. This case would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the new budget constraint and the relevant indifference curve occurred below point B and to the right. Conversely, if the substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect on is relatively stronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react to the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods. In this case, his optimal choice after the price change will be above and to the left of choice B on the new budget constraint.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057311419728">Although the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a sequence of events, it should be remembered that they are twin components of a single cause&#8212;a change in price. Although you can analyze them separately, the two effects are always proceeding hand in hand, happening at the same time.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp136737136"><h1 data-type="title">Indifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal Choices</h1>
<p id="fs-idp85077728">The concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any household choice, including the labor-leisure choice or the intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the labor-leisure choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an intertemporal choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of present and future consumption that provide a certain level of utility. The general shapes of the indifference curves&#8212;downward sloping, steeper on the left and flatter on the right&#8212;also remain the same.</p>

<p id="fs-idp75821024"><strong data-effect="bold">A Labor-Leisure Example</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp174073152">Petunia is working at a job that pays $12 per hour but she gets a raise to $20 per hour. After family responsibilities and sleep, she has 80 hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the highest level of utility for Petunia, on her original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the lower indifference curve (Ul). Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus 50 hours per week of work, with income of $600 per week (that is, 50 hours of work at $12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to $20 per hour, which shifts her budget constraint to the right. Her new utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget constraint is tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh. At B, Petunia has 40 hours of leisure per week and works 40 hours, with income of $800 per week (that is, 40 hours of work at $20 per hour).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">Effects of a Change in Petunia&#8217;s Wage </div><figcaption>Petunia starts at choice A, the tangency between her original budget constraint and the lower indifference curve Ul. The wage increase shifts her budget constraint to the right, so that she can now choose B on indifference curve Uh. The substitution effect is the movement from A to C. In this case, the substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is relatively more expensive, and more income, which is relatively cheaper to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B. The income effect in this example leads to greater consumption of both goods. Overall, in this example, income rises because of both substitution and income effects. However, leisure declines because of the substitution effect but increases because of the income effect&#8212;leading, in Petunia&#8217;s case, to an overall increase in the quantity of leisure consumed.</figcaption>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp63146000">Substitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how Petunia reacts to a higher hourly wage. The dashed line serves as the tool for separating the two effects on the graph.</p>
<p id="fs-idp176034368">The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at the same level of utility. The slope of the budget constraint in a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">labor-leisure diagram</span> is determined by the wage rate. Thus, the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same level of utility or &#8220;buying power.&#8221; The shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income. The &#8220;s&#8221; arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show the substitution effect on leisure and on income.</p>
<p id="fs-idp225599456">The income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure budget constraint to the right, makes it possible for Petunia to reach a higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C to point B; that is, it shows how Petunia&#8217;s behavior would change in response to a higher level of utility or &#8220;buying power,&#8221; with the wage rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to the new budget constraint). The income effect, encouraging Petunia to consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn with arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp161411424">Putting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by moving from choice A to choice B. This movement involves choosing more income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made income relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income effect of higher wages has made it possible to have more income and more leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more leisure because, according to Petunia&#8217;s preferences, the income effect that encourages choosing more leisure is stronger than the substitution effect that encourages choosing less leisure.</p>
<p id="fs-idp71941920"><a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> represents only Petunia&#8217;s preferences. Other people might make other choices. For example, a person whose substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each other might react to a higher wage with a choice like D, exactly above the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of the higher wages in the form of income while working the same number of hours. Yet another person, whose substitution effect on leisure outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a choice like F, where the response to higher wages is to work more hours and earn much more income. To represent these different preferences, you could easily draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new budget constraint at D or F, rather than at B.</p>
<p id="fs-idp142022384"><strong data-effect="bold">An Intertemporal Choice Example</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp104330528">Quentin has saved up $10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all of it on a vacation in the present, and then will save the rest for another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he expects to earn a total 80% rate of return. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows Quentin&#8217;s budget constraint and his indifference curves between present consumption and future consumption. The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his original intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming $6,000, saving $4,000 for the future, and expecting with the accumulated interest to have $7,200 for future consumption (that is, $4,000 in current financial savings plus the 80% rate of return).</p>
<p id="fs-idp135883616">However, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was unrealistically high. A more realistic expectation is that over five years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal budget constraint has pivoted to the left, so that his original utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will Quentin react to the lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount? Again, the language of substitution and income effects provides a framework for thinking about the motivations behind various choices. The dashed line, which is a graphical tool to separate the substitution and income effect, is carefully inserted with the same slope as the new opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so that it shows no change in utility or &#8220;buying power.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idp95696656">The substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his consumption because the lower rate of return makes future consumption relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper. The movement from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin substitutes toward more present consumption and less future consumption in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The substitution arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show the direction of the substitution effect motivation. The substitution effect suggests that, because of the lower interest rate, Quentin should consume more in the present and less in the future.</p>
<p id="fs-idp129910944">Quentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return shifts the budget constraint to the left, which means that Quentin&#8217;s utility or &#8220;buying power&#8221; is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal goods) encourages less of both present and future consumption. The impact of the income effect on reducing present and future consumption in this example is shown with &#8220;i&#8221; arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

The dashed line is drawn parallel to the new budget set, so that its slope reflects the lower rate of return, but is tangent to the original indifference curve. The movement from A to C is the substitution effect: in this case, future consumption has become relatively more expensive, and present consumption has become relatively cheaper. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction in utility or &#8220;buying power&#8221; that causes a move to a lower indifference curve Ul, but with the relative price the same. It means less present and less future consumption. In the move from A to B, the substitution effect on present consumption is greater than the income effect, so the overall result is more present consumption.

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp62769120">Taking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging Quentin toward more present and less future consumption, because present consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is encouraging him to less present and less future consumption, because the lower interest rate is pushing him to a lower level of utility. For Quentin&#8217;s personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so that, overall, he reacts to the lower rate of return with more present consumption and less savings at choice B. However, other people might have different preferences. They might react to a lower rate of return by choosing the same level of present consumption and savings at choice D, or by choosing less present consumption and more savings at a point like F. For these other sets of preferences, the income effect of a lower rate of return on present consumption would be relatively stronger, while the substitution effect would be relatively weaker.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm95344128"><h1 data-type="title">Sketching Substitution and Income Effects</h1>
<p id="fs-idm120124528">Indifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the choices that provide a single level of utility. They eliminate any need for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the process of making utility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the complementary motivations that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of return&#8212;namely, the substitution and income effects.</p>
<p id="fs-idp45220496">If you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show substitution and income effects so that the points of tangency all come out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.</p>

<p id="fs-idm40391616">Step 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two goods, which this example will call &#8220;candy&#8221; and &#8220;movies.&#8221; Choose a point A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be tangent&#8212;but it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve just yet. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

    </span>
    
  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm89857856">Step 2. Now the price of movies changes: let&#8217;s say that it rises. That shifts the budget set inward. You know that the higher price will push the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a lower indifference curve. But at this stage, draw only the new budget set. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

    </span>
    
  </figure> 
<p id="fs-idm97012240">Step 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income effects is to insert a dashed line, parallel to the new budget line. This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the two changes: (1) the effect on consumption of the two goods of the shift in prices&#8212;with the level of utility remaining unchanged&#8212;which is the substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods of shifting from one indifference curve to the other&#8212;with relative prices staying unchanged&#8212;which is the income effect. The dashed line is inserted in this step. The trick is to have the dashed line travel close to the original choice A, but not directly through point A. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_010"><div data-type="title" class="title"/><figcaption/>

    </span>
    
  </figure> 
<p id="fs-idp46369712">Step 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent to both point A on the original budget line and to a point C on the dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency point C where the original indifference curve touches the dashed line, and then to draw the original indifference curve through A and C. The substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original indifference curve as prices change but the level of utility holds constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to less consumed of the good that is relatively more expensive, as shown by the &#8220;s&#8221; (substitution) arrow on the vertical axis, and more consumed of the good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the &#8220;s&#8221; arrow on the horizontal axis.

<p id="fs-idm151335216">Step 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set. When you choose point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income effect to have a larger impact on the good (in this case, candy) on the horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical line with point A (as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be exactly offsetting the substitution effect on the horizontal axis. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original point A, then the substitution effect will exceed the income effect. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A, then the income effect will exceed the substitution effect. The income effect is the movement from C to B, showing how choices shifted as a result of the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels of utility, with relative prices remaining the same. With normal goods, the negative income effect means less consumed of each good, as shown by the direction of the &#8220;i&#8221; (income effect) arrows on the vertical and horizontal axes.

<p id="fs-idm96990912">In sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to practice some of the following variations: (1) Price falls instead of a rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or the horizontal axis; (3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution effect exceeds the income effect; the income effect exceeds the substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.</p>
<p id="fs-idm47230608">One final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new indifference curve, and parallel to the original budget line, rather than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new budget line. Some students find this approach more intuitively clear. The answers you get about the direction and relative sizes of the substitution and income effects, however, should be the same.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm18105360"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm11709600">An indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows the tradeoffs between two goods. All points along a single indifference curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves represent higher levels of utility. Indifference curves slope downward because, if utility is to remain the same at all points along the curve, a reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be counterbalanced by an increase in the quantity of the good on the horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on the far left and flatter on the far right, because of diminishing marginal utility.</p>
<p id="fs-idm26507184">The utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the point of tangency where the budget constraint touches an indifference curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two effects: a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy less of what is relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The income effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy more of both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if utility falls (if they are both normal goods).</p>
<p id="fs-idm42064832">In a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of a wage increase is to choose more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its opportunity cost has increased. The income effect of a wage increase is to choose more of leisure and income, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse these directions.</p>
<p id="fs-idm19851904">In an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is now cheaper to earn future consumption and less present consumption (more savings), since the opportunity cost of present consumption in terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more of both present and future consumption, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of an interest rate decrease would reverse these directions.</p>

The price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make, including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond. The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm. The concept of a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">present discounted value (PDV)</span>, which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments, can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation will require an 
<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">interest rate</span>. For example, if the interest rate is 10%, then a payment of $110 a year from now will have a present discounted value of $100&#8212;that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $110 in the future. We will first shows how to apply the idea of present discounted value to a stock and then we will show how to apply it to a bond.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm37811152"><h1 data-type="title">Applying Present Discounted Value to a Stock</h1>
<p id="fs-idm32301200">Consider the case of Babble, Inc., a company that offers speaking lessons. For the sake of simplicity, say that the founder of Babble is 63 years old and plans to retire in two years, at which point the company will be disbanded. The company is selling 200 shares of stock and profits are expected to be $15 million right away, in the present, $20 million one year from now, and $25 million two years from now. All profits will be paid out as dividends to shareholders as they occur. Given this information, what will an investor pay for a share of stock in this company?</p>
<p id="fs-idp104256688">A financial investor, thinking about what future payments are worth in the present, will need to choose an interest rate. This interest rate will reflect the rate of return on other available financial investment opportunities, which is the opportunity cost of investing financial capital, and also a risk premium (that is, using a higher interest rate than the rates available elsewhere if this investment appears especially risky). In this example, say that the financial investor decides that appropriate interest rate to value these future payments is 15%.</p>
<p id="fs-idp68435776"><a href="#Table_D_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how to calculate the present discounted value of the future profits. For each time period, when a benefit is going to be received, apply the formula:</p>

<p id="fs-idp7437008">Next, add up all the present values for the different time periods to get a final answer. The present value calculations ask what the amount in the future is worth in the present, given the 15% interest rate. Notice that a different PDV calculation needs to be done separately for amounts received at different times. Then, divide the PDV of total profits by the number of shares, 200 in this case: 51.3 million/200 = 0.2565 million. The price per share should be about $256,500 per share.</p>
<p id="fs-idp55661344">Of course, in the real world expected profits are a best guess, not a hard piece of data. Deciding which interest rate to apply for discounting to the present can be tricky. One needs to take into account both potential capital gains from the future sale of the stock and also dividends that might be paid. Differences of opinion on these issues are exactly why some financial investors want to buy a stock that other people want to sell: they are more optimistic about its future prospects. Conceptually, however, it all comes down to what you are willing to pay in the present for a stream of benefits to be received in the future.</p>

<p id="fs-idm9262656">A similar calculation works in the case of bonds. <a href="/contents/fcbdbc82-6651-4c21-bf07-a1258cbf3fb5@5" class="target-chapter">Financial Markets</a> explains that if the interest rate falls after a bond is issued, so that the investor has locked in a higher rate, then that bond will sell for more than its face value. Conversely, if the interest rate rises after a bond is issued, then the investor is locked into a lower rate, and the bond will sell for less than its face value. The present value calculation sharpens this intuition.</p><p id="fs-idm75850240">Think about a simple two-year bond. It was issued for $3,000 at an interest rate of 8%. Thus, after the first year, the bond pays interest of 240 (which is 3,000 &#215; 8%). At the end of the second year, the bond pays $240 in interest, plus the $3,000 in principle. Calculate how much this bond is worth in the present if the discount rate is 8%. Then, recalculate if interest rates rise and the applicable discount rate is 11%. To carry out these calculations, look at the stream of payments being received from the bond in the future and figure out what they are worth in present discounted value terms. The calculations applying the present value formula are shown in <a href="#Table_D_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idm48835696">The first calculation shows that the present value of a $3,000 bond, issued at 8%, is just $3,000. After all, that is how much money the borrower is receiving. The calculation confirms that the present value is the same for the lender. The bond is moving money around in time, from those willing to save in the present to those who want to borrow in the present, but the present value of what is received by the borrower is identical to the present value of what will be repaid to the lender.</p>
<p id="fs-idm70689696">The second calculation shows what happens if the interest rate rises from 8% to 11%. The actual dollar payments in the first column, as determined by the 8% interest rate, do not change. However, the present value of those payments, now discounted at a higher interest rate, is lower. Even though the future dollar payments that the bond is receiving have not changed, a person who tries to sell the bond will find that the investment&#8217;s value has fallen.</p>
<p id="fs-idp12705744">Again, real-world calculations are often more complex, in part because, not only the interest rate prevailing in the market, but also the riskiness of whether the borrower will repay the loan, will change. In any case, the price of a bond is always the present value of a stream of future expected payments.</p>

<p id="fs-idm86792288">Present discounted value is a widely used analytical tool outside the world of finance. Every time a business thinks about making a physical capital investment, it must compare a set of present costs of making that investment to the present discounted value of future benefits. When government thinks about a proposal to, for example, add safety features to a highway, it must compare costs incurred in the present to benefits received in the future. Some academic disputes over environmental policies, like how much to reduce carbon dioxide emissions because of the risk that they will lead to a warming of global temperatures several decades in the future, turn on how one compares present costs of pollution control with long-run future benefits. Someone who wins the lottery and is scheduled to receive a string of payments over 30 years might be interested in knowing what the present discounted value is of those payments. Whenever a string of costs and benefits stretches from the present into different times in the future, present discounted value becomes an indispensable tool of analysis.</p>

The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed before the AD/AS model was popularized.

This approach is strongly rooted in the fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending in the economy, with no explicit mention of aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is possible to draw some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the diagram).</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm190331616"><h1 data-type="title">The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram</h1>

<p id="fs-idm70474896">Remember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on final goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of firms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">national income</span> (Y). At some points in the discussion that follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as &#8220;national income.&#8221; Both axes are measured in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.</p>

<p id="fs-idp738288"><strong data-effect="bold">The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp9040">The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion. The first is a vertical line showing the level of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">potential GDP</span>. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital.</p><p id="fs-idm19791120">The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p id="fs-idm90765712">When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real GDP</span>&#8212;because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal&#8212;which will only occur along the 45-degree line.</p>

<p id="fs-idm9756208"><strong data-effect="bold">The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm83926688">The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate expenditure schedule</span>, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line&#8212;at point E<sub>0</sub> in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>&#8212;will show the equilibrium for the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how to interpret it.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm65474512"><h1 data-type="title">Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</h1>
<p id="fs-idm80189360">Aggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure line&#8212;consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports&#8212;the key question is how expenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.</p>

<p id="fs-idp17604752"><strong data-effect="bold">Consumption as a Function of National Income</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp765136">How do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their income: consume it or save it (for the moment, let&#8217;s ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">marginal propensity to consume (MPC)</span>, is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">marginal propensity to save (MPS)</span> is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true that:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm152464192"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>MPC&#160;+&#160;MPS&#160;=&#160;1</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>MPC&#160;+&#160;MPS&#160;=&#160;1</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div><p id="fs-idm8803472">For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.</p><p id="fs-idm31674640">With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. (Note that we use &#8220;Aggregate Expenditure&#8221; on the vertical axis in this and the following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)</p>
<p id="fs-idm137589280">An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume something. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200. At an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income, plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#Table_E_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is called the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">consumption function</span>.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_012"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Consumption Function </div><figcaption>In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the level of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national income level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm38531264">However, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in <a href="#Table_E_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. When the consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or down in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity to consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one. However, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.</p>

<p id="fs-idp1032176"><strong data-effect="bold">Investment as a Function of National Income</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm51427008">Investment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do <em data-effect="italics">not</em> depend primarily on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an investment function where the level of investment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">investment function</span> shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Investment Function </div><figcaption>The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national income. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the investment function to shift up or down.</figcaption>

    </span>
    
  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp1102784">The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other factors that vary investment&#8212;new technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment&#8212;can cause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.</p>

<p id="fs-idm43753280"><strong data-effect="bold">Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm97987056">In the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Government Spending Function </div><figcaption>The level of government spending is determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.</figcaption>

    </span>
    
  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm222269200">The situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For example, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the economy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local taxes together, government typically collects about 30&#8211;35 % of income as taxes.</p>
<p id="fs-idm116644640"><a href="#Table_E_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first column shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of 30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without taxes, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows.</p>

Again, as in the case of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not imply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal axis&#8212;that is, a country&#8217;s own level of domestic production&#8212;and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate demand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to shift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_025"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Export and Import Functions </div><figcaption>(a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy.

(b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy.

<p id="fs-idm64527744">Indeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from 5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The multiplier equation in this case is:</p>

<p id="fs-idm6057216">This algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political considerations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without exports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government, exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and imports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.</p>

The first three columns in <a href="#Table_E_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> are lifted from the earlier <a href="#Table_E_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, which showed how to bring taxes into the consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 &#215; 0.8) from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300, and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate expenditures</span>, sums up C + I + G + X &#8211; M. This <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate expenditure line</span> is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_018" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idm15719488">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate expenditure function</span> is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import function. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures&#8212;which do not vary with national income. The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax rate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function flatter&#8212;because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on domestic goods and services.</p>
<p id="fs-idm85931200">The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.</p>

<p id="fs-idm23589264">With the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential GDP line.</p>

<p id="fs-idp53266064"><strong data-effect="bold">Where Equilibrium Occurs</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp67324256">The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X &#8211; M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_018" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, this point of equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off <a href="#Table_E_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp18136272">The meaning of &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; remains the same; that is, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">equilibrium</span> is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_019" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold&#8212;not a sustainable state of affairs.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_019"><div data-type="title" class="title">Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram </div><figcaption>If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idp46315200">Conversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L&#8212;where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line.</p>

<p id="fs-idp103029296">For example, <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at point E<sub>0</sub>, which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur. The distance between an output level like E<sub>0</sub> that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recessionary gap</span>. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.</p>

<p id="fs-idp32951584">What might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at equilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time; remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession away.</p>
<p id="fs-idp12357952">The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE<sub>0</sub> to AE<sub>1</sub>. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> now occurs at potential GDP as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a).</p>
<p id="fs-idp34698128">Conversely, <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE<sub>0</sub>) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> and potential GDP is called an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflationary gap</span>. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a na&#239;ve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired&#8212;even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and market institutions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp67256384">The inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.</p>
<p id="fs-idp170727680">The appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line AE<sub>0</sub> and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential GDP at $7,000. If AE<sub>0</sub> shifts down to AE<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium is at E<sub>1</sub>, then the economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government expenditures.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm3201520"><h1 data-type="title">The Multiplier Effect</h1>
<p id="fs-idm129862048">The Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 &#8211; $700 = $100; so raise government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers, and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is called the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">multiplier effect</span>: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.</p>

<p id="fs-idm140877600"><strong data-effect="bold">How Does the Multiplier Work?</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp8275424">To understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment, potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced goods and services.</p>
<p id="fs-idm151342576">As shown in the calculations in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#Table_E_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, so that an additional $28.09 (that is, 0.53 &#215; $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 &#215; $28.09).</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_022"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Multiplier Effect </div><figcaption>An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle gets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100 raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm130628256">Thus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government spending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the figure shows the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed&#8212;nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.</p>

<p id="fs-idm5290256">The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports. These three factors are known as &#8220;leakages,&#8221; because they determine how much demand &#8220;leaks out&#8221; in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high. Conversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second, third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages&#8212;a change in the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import&#8212;will change the size of the multiplier.</p>

<p id="fs-idp13998432">Returning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows.</p>

<p id="fs-idp29131040">The multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the aggregate expenditure function (AE<sub>0</sub>) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE<sub>1</sub>, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to reach potential GDP.</p>
<p id="fs-idm45883424">Now, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income&#8211;expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic calculation.</p>
<p id="fs-idm1693568">The multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm26857904" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?</div>
<p id="fs-idm41030640">Attracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent article, &#8220;Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,&#8221; James Joyner of <em data-effect="italics">Outside the Beltway</em> looked at public financing for NFL teams. Joyner&#8217;s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.</p>
<p id="fs-idm42568208">Siegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let&#8217;s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let&#8217;s assume that they save one-third of their after-tax income.</p>
<p id="fs-idm39901248">However, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let&#8217;s say that one-half of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm121942384">Now, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional athletes, so let&#8217;s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher proportion of their income on local goods&#8212;say, 65%.</p>
<p id="fs-idm3815184">If these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is recycled into the local economy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm156385920">Siegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet search for &#8220;economic impact of sports&#8221; will yield numerous reports questioning this economic development strategy.</p>

<p id="fs-idm166600240"><strong data-effect="bold">Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm92997648">Is an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.</p>
<p id="fs-idm66008896">However, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm142495216"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm118399840">The expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on the vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal axis can also be interpreted as national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in the economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at potential GDP, or below or above that level.</p>
<p id="fs-idm16692272">The consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity to consume means a flatter consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is drawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current level of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate of return in the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy. Taxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function. The export function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as a result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as changes in exchange rates. The import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports means a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.</p>
<p id="fs-idm24297856">In a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a recessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.</p>
<p id="fs-idm4264320">The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as cumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings, taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:</p>

      <p id="fs-idm58740736">Explain how the multiplier works. Use an MPC of 80% in an example.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p id="fs-idm48927152"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the economy. It is based on the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) which tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80% then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer, $0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received by another person. In turn, 80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The impact of the multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the multiplier, take the 1/1 &#8211; F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures on imports.</p>
